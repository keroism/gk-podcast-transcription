00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,947
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday July 7th.

2
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:12,111
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,219
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,559
Rym: tonight We talk a bit about cheating and all of its stripes and flavors.

5
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:36,217
Scott: So I have actually believe it or not been playing some video games lately.

7
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:44,459
Rym: wait wait wait a new Video game because you could say that and just be playing punch-out the old punch-out as was often the case.

8
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,892
Scott: No, no, I'm playing well depending on your point of view.

9
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:49,615
Scott: well one of them.

10
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,000
Scott: well first of all I've played this.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:01:00,870
Scott: There's a game called trine TR I any and the demo is on steam and also the full versions on steam for $30 And I think it might be on ps3.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,027
Scott: I don't know, but it is a side scrolling Puzzly platforming game.

13
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:13,294
Scott: basically you have a wizard a knight and a thief and they each do different things And you have to you know get to the end of the level.

14
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:16,146
Rym: well we were trying To play it over the weekend.

15
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:19,720
Scott: actually I did play it and the thing about this game is it's co-op.

16
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,100
Scott: You can play one two or three players on the same machine.

17
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:27,540
Scott: Well this makes for a really really interesting time really fun.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,952
Rym: The problem was we had four people who wanted to play it.

19
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:32,799
Rym: only three people can play it.

20
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:34,812
Rym: No one wanted to pay $30 for it.

21
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:41,594
Scott: When this game goes on if you got tons of money sure go $30 go nuts.

22
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:47,155
Scott: right the thing is there's no network Multiplayer, so it's sort of like ah you got to play locally got it.

23
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,421
Rym: at the same time It's.

24
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:55,351
Rym: while I can't excuse the lack of the online multiplayer I will at least say that local multiplayer for a game like that.

25
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:58,560
Rym: It's pretty great is much more satisfying than playing online.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,182
Scott: I think it's.

27
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,794
Scott: it's basically if you liked you know the bionic commando rearmed.

28
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,660
Scott: You know play this thing.

29
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,545
Scott: Get three friends together.

30
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,711
Scott: play this co-op locally on your PC.

31
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:15,034
Scott: get you know three Xbox 360 game pads You know so that you can actually play it because to play with the keyboard of them.

32
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:16,360
Scott: It was just terrible forget it.

33
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:20,418
Rym: So speaking of every game if you never played bionic commando rearmed buy it and play it.

34
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,552
Scott: no Yeah, it was great.

35
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:25,186
Rym: Yeah, like we got it We should beat the co-op sometimes.

36
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:27,536
Scott: so but no, but there's a free demo of Trine.

37
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:32,740
Scott: so play the demo which is all I've played and You'll probably like it immediately.

38
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:34,207
Scott: And I guess what.

39
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,880
Scott: maybe we'll talk more about that game if and when?

40
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,958
Scott: We play by the full version and play co-op through the whole thing.

41
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:45,145
Scott: who knows I've also been playing Blood Bowl.

42
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:46,452
Rym: what the old board game?

43
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,866
Scott: no well Yeah, I'll tell you a little.

44
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,013
Scott: you know I'm probably gonna repeat what I'm about to say.

45
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:56,009
Scott: if you know cuz we're definitely gonna do A whole show about blood Bowl the video game.

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,176
Scott: Oh, yeah a new one, but I'll repeat I'll say stuff now and repeat it later.

47
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:06,374
Scott: anyway Blood Bowl was an old board game a miniatures board game made by Games Workshop.

48
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:13,685
Scott: the same people make Warhammer and such and basically What it is is it's fantasy football But it's not fantasy.

49
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:24,120
Scott: but it's not fantasy football in terms of like yahoo sports fantasy football It's get the ball in the end zone with orcs dwarves and elves.

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,668
Scott: That's what is that kind of fantasy football.

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,418
Rym: very much in the Warhammer universe.

52
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:32,690
Scott: very much The game itself the board game.

53
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,733
Scott: you can still buy it.

54
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,440
Scott: I think it shouldn't be too hard to find.

55
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,968
Scott: I'm not sure how imprinted is.

56
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,420
Rym: Millennium Games always has at least like one copy.

57
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:44,442
Scott: I could definitely I if I wanted to I could get a new copy, but they're like $75.

58
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:45,426
Scott: There was a board.

59
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:49,142
Scott: there was a video game version of it for DOS back in the day Right.

60
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:55,930
Scott: then there was as company sort of made a game called Chaos League and Games Workshop was like hey What the fuck is this Chaos League?

61
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,220
Scott: shit Blood Bowl thieves?

62
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,608
Scott: You know what the fuck.

63
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:15,611
Scott: but instead of getting all stupid They just got those guys And they had to make Blood Bowl the video game and you can get it right now for $50, which is a lot You know, but and the game has many problems many problems, however Deep inside the game.

64
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:16,820
Scott: Well, not too deep inside.

65
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:33,640
Scott: you can play Blood Bowl the original board game as per the Living Blood Bowl 5.0 rule set exactly According to those rules and you don't have to deal with setting up the pieces or rolling the dice or any of that annoying Shit, you'll never have like rules arguments.

66
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:37,200
Scott: You never had to get your measuring stick or deal with any of that bullshit.

67
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:42,467
Scott: You can play a game of Blood Bowl in a short amount of time Even though the user interface is bleh.

68
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,313
Scott: You can play it online against people.

69
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:49,832
Scott: So if you like Blood Bowl It's a game for you and it's probably worth $50.

70
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,820
Scott: I've been playing it quite a bit.

71
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:58,360
Rym: It's tricky watching Scott play because he'll play it and he'll come downstairs or something to say man that game is awesome.

72
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,910
Rym: But then an hour later, he'll be playing.

73
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:00,454
Rym: it was like man.

74
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,959
Scott: that game sucks Usually depends on if I roll the dice.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,579
Scott: Well, if I virtually roll the dice well or not.

76
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:10,560
Rym: It got to the point to where I'd come home from work and I just ask him so is Blood Bowl good or bad?

77
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,260
Scott: It's it's one of those games where you know, some games have a lot of randomness, right?

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,159
Scott: Let's say monopoly where your whole game rests on the rolls of the dice.

79
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:22,774
Scott: Or you have a game with no randomness or almost no randomness like say go right?

80
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:28,739
Scott: Yeah, but Blood Bowl It's like it has this randomness, but the randomness is you know You can mitigate for it.

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,212
Scott: You know you could you know gate.

82
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:43,160
Scott: for yes You act you act in such a way and take moves in such a way that you know Even if you roll poorly and you get the worst possible result You'll still be alright and you're not gonna just lose because of it.

83
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,439
Rym: I would say more to for a game like Blood Bowl specifically Blood Bowl a game where tackling may or may not involve death.

84
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:57,458
Rym: It's you know steam rollers on the field, but you know, maybe at halftime the ref will say hey, that's an illegal weapon Stop using it.

85
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:11,934
Rym: but the randomness is such that a game like this will have those that tension of a real sports game where One team might be better than the other team and the game might be going pretty solidly But someone could hit a grand slam at any time.

86
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:13,380
Scott: Well, the base has to be loaded first.

87
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,920
Scott: But yeah, it's like they could load the base.

88
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:24,220
Scott: You know the randomness you mitigate for it you handle it and if you're a smart player You're not gonna lose just because you rolled poorly and the mitigate for that's not how you use that word.

89
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:27,217
Rym: No, you just you say you mitigate it anyway.

90
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,740
Scott: But I don't understand what you're saying before anyway.

91
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:40,140
Scott: But there's occasions where one role is like a huge deal and it actually ends up being like a real sport.

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,620
Scott: You know occasionally someone catches that long bomb and it's just crazy awesome.

93
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,046
Scott: And you know, it's it's.

94
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:51,278
Scott: you know, if that the other team gets that crazy awesome long bomb then you hate the game.

95
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,787
Scott: Yeah If you get it's the best game ever.

96
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,273
Scott: look at that dramatic, you know.

97
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,820
Scott: last play the game touchdown.

98
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,132
Rym: We have to play the game a lot more before we talk about it.

99
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:00,875
Scott: That is correct.

100
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:01,820
Rym: stand chill details.

101
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,127
Scott: Let us move to news.

102
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,192
Rym: So what do you have?

103
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,498
Scott: What do I have?

104
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:16,603
Scott: Well There is a company that in the past Well, there are actually many game companies that in the past made great games and really nowadays either don't make such good games Or don't make games at all.

105
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:24,459
Scott: and one such company is Lucas Arts, which you know is definitely if you don't know It is tied to Lucasfilm.

106
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:31,670
Scott: But they made Star Wars some of the better and some of the worst games to come out for that era thing is back In the day, they didn't just make Star Wars games.

107
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,820
Scott: Well, they did although they did make Star Wars games.

108
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,840
Scott: They made other games like well, Indiana Jones adventure games, which was also a Lucas property.

109
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:51,420
Scott: I made things like the dig and loom and And full throttle and a lot of point-and-click adventure games, which you can play in the ever-famous scum VM.

110
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:54,486
Scott: But they made some other games too.

111
00:07:54,547 --> 00:08:06,420
Scott: And actually they've got lots of recent games like, you know, Lego, Indiana Jones Lego Star Wars The defunct Star Wars galaxy, I think was actually Sony or those Lego games.

112
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:17,532
Rym: I always I really like the style of them But you can't play those games for more than 15 minutes with a thinking adult brain and not Continue to keep that thinking adult brain active.

113
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:21,695
Rym: Yeah, that game is just oh my god The cutscenes are really funny.

114
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,823
Rym: they are Not games.

115
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,352
Scott: Well, it's a walk around and hit things.

116
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:26,793
Scott: That's it.

117
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,097
Scott: That's gauntlet.

118
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:28,880
Scott: That's what it is gone.

119
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:32,720
Rym: I think we spent more time killing each other in the ready room than we ever did playing the game.

120
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,280
Scott: Yeah, all those Lego games like Lego Star Wars is gauntlet.

121
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:46,140
Scott: Anyway, so the thing is a lot of these games have been unavailable for a very long time Which is why scum VM exists because people wanted to play old Lucas arts adventure games.

122
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,934
Scott: They loved on modern computers and so they made scum VM.

123
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:55,431
Scott: now the thing is Just now for the first time in a long time.

124
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,800
Scott: Some of these games are actually going to return.

125
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,553
Scott: First of all, they're making a new monkey island game.

126
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,480
Scott: It's not a remake of an old monkey island game.

127
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,487
Scott: It's actually a brand new monkey island game.

128
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,019
Scott: It's all 3d and shit and it's coming out soon.

129
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:19,600
Scott: ish I don't know exactly when they're also Releasing the original monkey island But it's gonna be all new just like the new monkey on with 3d and the whole thing as far as I know.

130
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:27,960
Scott: so if you never played the monkey island and You want to play it legitimately and not just go download and use scum VM.

131
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:34,580
Scott: You can buy that and you'll also if you're a fan of the old monkey island You're the kind of person who played them all ten times.

132
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,604
Scott: like I know many people are.

133
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:41,315
Scott: you can go and get this new monkey on game and continue in your 3-point action.

134
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:41,880
Rym: monkey island.

135
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:52,640
Rym: They're very important to play at least once because you'd be surprised how many of the kind of offhand references and gaming culture Came from those games that people don't even recognize anymore.

136
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,940
Rym: Like they'll make a joke but not realize that monkey island is where that joke came from.

137
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:00,152
Scott: I remember I got a CD from a PC gamer magazine.

138
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,399
Rym: Oh my god coconut monkey coconut.

139
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,347
Scott: Hello I'm coconut monkey.

140
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,352
Rym: How do you keep beating me?

141
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,160
Rym: Even you have neither arms nor legs.

142
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,557
Rym: It in fact was a coconut monkey CD, oh my god, I should make coconut monkey my thing of the day.

143
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,320

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,205
Scott: Oh, is he on YouTube?

00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:14,029
Rym: I'll find him.

146
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,693
Rym: you keep talking.

147
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:15,196
Scott: All right.

148
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:32,113
Scott: Hello I'm coconut monkey and on my PC gamer CD that Scott got in his magazine There was a. There was a the full version of monkey island and if you paid $20 you could get a code that would unlock it.

149
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,859
Scott: so you didn't need to go and buy a CD.

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,708
Scott: I never paid that $20.

151
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,310
Rym: Oh my god.

152
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,276
Rym: There's a whole ton of coconut monkey in here.

153
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:42,150
Rym: Oh shit I think I got anything in the day.

154
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,733

Scott: Anyway the So yeah, they're also the bigger.

156
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:51,760
Scott: the main news here is not what I just said about monkey island or PC gamer CDs.

157
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:59,432
Scott: It's that Lucas arts is putting a bunch of games on Steam tomorrow, of course, you're probably listening to this tomorrow.

00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,520
Scott: So today July what 8th?

Rym: You interrupted me.

167
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:16,535
Scott: Yep loom loom for people who don't know is a point-and-click adventure game.

168
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:24,528
Scott: if As far as I know it was the first ever game released on CD-ROM It's also kind of a special game.

169
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:25,873
Scott: It's very special.

170
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:30,596
Scott: It's probably not like any other game Any other game you've played.

171
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,343
Scott: yeah It's not doom.

172
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:33,047
Scott: It's loom.

173
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,060
Scott: Yes a loom you use to weave things.

174
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:43,889
Rym: I I witnessed not that long ago the saddest conversation I've ever seen online That basically went along the lines of man.

175
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,554
Rym: I just got a copy of loom.

176
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:46,597
Rym: That game was awesome.

177
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:47,700
Rym: Oh you mean doom?

178
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:48,927
Rym: Yeah, that was pretty awesome.

179
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:49,691
Rym: No loom.

180
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,160
Rym: There was a game called loom.

181
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:55,614
Scott: Yes, there was a game called loom is pretty significant.

182
00:11:55,655 --> 00:12:05,405
Rym: yep the dig Dangerous Lego Indiana Jones Star Wars Battlefront 2 Star Wars Republic commandos Star Wars Starfighter Thrillville off the rails.

183
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,470
Rym: I don't know what that is.

184
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,052
Scott: that is either.

185
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:09,924
Scott: people like those Battlefront games But you know.

186
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,852
Scott: obviously you know none of these.

187
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:16,710
Scott: some of these games might be exciting to you especially probably the loom and the dig and fate of Atlantis.

188
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,393
Scott: right those are.

189
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:23,458
Scott: those are good point-and-click adventures, but Nothing else really that exciting as far as I'm concerned.

190
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,960
Scott: however What is exciting is that look LucasArts is putting games on Steam?

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,147
Scott: This is just the beginning.

192
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,799
Scott: if this is the beginning that's a pretty damn good beginning.

193
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:33,342
Scott: look There's.

194
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,919
Rym: they started with what ten games, and they're all just straight up.

195
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:53,872
Rym: you know pixel for pixel ports and the question the obvious thing to say is is TIE fighter coming question mark question mark question mark exclamation point and aside TIE fighter and TIE fighter CD which was just TIE fighter remade a year later But well not even remade.

196
00:12:53,892 --> 00:13:00,858
Rym: just the graphics are made better Have been rated pretty consistently among some the greatest game ever made.

197
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:02,142
Scott: Yeah I mean this.

198
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:07,987
Scott: there's all sorts of old games that we rave about that are hard or Impossible to play in current days.

199
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:10,295
Scott: right we talk about games like you know or they are.

200
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:25,714
Scott: you can play them in current days But it's a little tricky right we talk about like I mega TF ain't around tribes - right TIE fighter is probably like the one old Game it was so great yet like this.

201
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,380
Scott: I don't even know how to play it today.

202
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,734
Scott: I couldn't even I still do even if I pirate it.

203
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:30,680
Scott: How would I get it to run?

204
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,639
Rym: I guess box its backspace for full throttle and then on my hat up down left and right would redirect all the shields.

205
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,139
Scott: no No, I mean how to get it to run.

206
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:43,093
Rym: Oh, I was playing it like a year and a half ago in DOS box.

207
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:44,456
Rym: Just fine really.

208
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,563
Scott: yeah might be worth pirating Pirating.

209
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:47,085
Rym: I own it.

210
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,651
Rym: I still have the CD.

211
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,016
Rym: It's under my bed in fact.

212
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:50,940
Rym: I can kick the box.

213
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,347
Rym: It's in with my foot right now.

214
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,618
Scott: Why don't we get that shit going you want to?

215
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:07,509
Rym: Tie fighter as I recall I believe was given the highest rating a game had ever been given by PC gamer when it came out and It was only beaten the following year by itself re-released.

216
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,611
Rym: oh shit tie fighter is just.

217
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:16,559
Rym: it was a. Actually a game came before it called x-wing and that game was okay, it was the same thing.

218
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,446
Scott: yeah It was a game where you fly an x-wing.

219
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:22,080
Rym: that was it and tie fighter was just x-wing kind of redone.

220
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:38,600
Rym: My graphics are better controls are better Gameplay was better, but more importantly You play as just some guy a low-level grunt high fighter pilot working for the Empire Which is a force of peace and prosperity fighting against these anarchist rebel scum of course and?

221
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:42,292
Rym: You're going around doing all the stuff that the Empire was doing.

222
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:44,760
Rym: that wasn't all necessarily that evil force.

223
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:50,720
Rym: You're also doing all the evil, but it's always portrayed in this very good way, and you know what?

224
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:01,758
Rym: Having played all of x-wing and having played all of tie fighter fuck the rebels That it is so much more fun and more rewarding to be a member of the nation of the Empire.

225
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:08,229
Rym: As uniforms nice Equipment everybody's real professional.

226
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,237
Scott: Yeah, who wants to fly like some piece of shit x-wing?

227
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,180
Scott: that's like falling apart.

228
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,040
Scott: Yeah, you can fly nice clean tie defender.

229
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,686
Rym: You don't get a tie defender.

230
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:17,867
Rym: only.

231
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:21,100
Rym: like the best of the best you're gonna be flying some tie fighter with no shields.

232
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:22,448
Scott: I'm the best of the best though.

233
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,280
Scott: Yeah, well you'll die like the rest You know loaded with like eight torpedoes.

234
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,998
Scott: Good times Ship actually works.

235
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:38,600
Scott: The thing is you look we're gonna link to some YouTube videos because barely anyone's actually played tie fighter this game.

236
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,506
Scott: This game is from what you're like 94.

237
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,901
Rym: I think it was released in 94 and then teen years old re-released in 95.

238
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,048
Scott: So it's 15 years old.

239
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,160
Scott: you needed a maybe for the 15th anniversary.

240
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,284
Scott: Maybe that maybe they are gonna.

241
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:53,798
Rym: basically needed your full keyboard ready to go and you had to memorize all the buttons.

242
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:58,519
Scott: look how Complicated this game is but yet look how many features it has that are just.

243
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:04,100
Scott: you know This is old DOS game and this game did shit that it is not present in modern games at all.

244
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:07,072
Scott: It's like games got worse and you look at this game.

245
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,196
Scott: It's like wow really that's 94 shit.

246
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,151
Scott: That's better than like any game out today.

247
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,760
Rym: I mean no game has come close to it.

248
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,520
Scott: There were like the voice acting is actually good like well.

249
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,873
Rym: Well now it is video game good.

250
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:19,497
Scott: It's not.

251
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:20,040
Scott: it's movie good.

252
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,285
Rym: It gets a little awkward.

253
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:22,228
Rym: star wars good.

254
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:24,556
Rym: some of the other cuts cut scenes quite.

255
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:25,480
Scott: star wars good.

256
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:26,603
Rym: Signal advice.

257
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,472
Rym: Admiral throng to have his tie squadrons launched immediately.

258
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:31,579
Scott: Yeah, these cutscenes are like amazing.

259
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,595
Rym: You just want to see more Admiral throng.

260
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:35,178
Scott: What's wrong with that?

261
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:41,096
Scott: Well thrown You know that this you actually have all these ships, you know like they actually.

262
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:47,219
Scott: you know like the configurations and you can have so many ships out in space all fighting at the same time and give guys orders.

263
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:55,613
Scott: and Like the game actually has a very high attention to detail Like let's say you got in a mission and Darth Vader's out with you on the mission.

264
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:59,064
Scott: if you accidentally give him orders You're in trouble.

265
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,292
Scott: Yeah, you don't tell him what to do.

266
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:02,616
Rym: Also, don't let him die.

267
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:04,464
Rym: He might do something stupid He might mess up.

268
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:05,992
Scott: Yeah, you can.

269
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,380
Scott: you can do pretty much anything.

270
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,657
Scott: I mean you could turn around and try to blow up the Star Destroyer if you want.

271
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:13,458
Scott: Yeah Yeah, good luck with that.

272
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:23,577
Rym: So I got good enough at the game where I would get bored and I would just get in like a tie advanced and just Try to destroy all of the capital ships in a mission and then hyperspace out.

273
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:29,137
Rym: Mm-hmm I did it once nice like I destroyed two Star Destroyers and my entire fleet.

274
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:29,880
Rym: It was awesome.

275
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:34,540
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know what would be really cool is if you did that then it would just load up x-wing.

276
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,780
Rym: There were games that came after that were updates.

277
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,785
Scott: Well x-wing vs tie fighter fuck that game.

278
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,991
Rym: that game was so unplayable and broken.

279
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:43,194
Scott: and then x-wing Alliance.

280
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:46,440
Rym: x-wing Alliance was actually really playable But it was too little too late.

281
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,314
Rym: It kind of came out at the end of the joystick era.

282
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:50,680
Rym: There are no longer joysticks.

283
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,214
Rym: We just now recently had that one Logitech flight stick.

284
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,480
Scott: I don't know what game they made that for.

285
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,154
Rym: I don't know why they made it.

286
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:00,460
Scott: Yeah I mean it looks pretty good from what I had to use it to find out.

287
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,113
Rym: I hope that it can be the chicken or the egg in the chicken egg conundrum of.

288
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:06,823
Rym: there are no free space shooters because there Aren't joysticks.

289
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,360
Rym: There are no joysticks because there aren't free space shooters, but no one's gonna pay that much.

290
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:15,794
Rym: But then again people bought that stupid console to play the met game on the Xbox.

291
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,900
Scott: not too many people though enough people.

292
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:25,395
Rym: Yeah, the steel battalion, especially considering that Gigantic monolithic console did almost nothing for the game.

293
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,900
Rym: You hit most of those buttons once.

294
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:35,113
Scott: Yeah I almost feel like maybe the time to come back with the free space shooter might have been like some years ago and people are really willing to buy plastic instruments.

295
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:44,424
Rym: tie fighter was just so great and They if they remade it if this game ever came out as an updated multiplayer game Oh my god I would.

296
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,674
Rym: I look forward to this and More so than I could have possibly looked forward to Team Fortress 2 or even NS2.

297
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,357
Scott: You heard it here.

298
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,927
Scott: first prediction 15th anniversary of tie fighter re-release.

299
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:58,659
Rym: I hope that by saying it we've made it so make it so.

300
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:01,871
Rym: You know what make it so is from right?

301
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:03,340
Rym: No, okay.

302
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:16,780
Rym: Anyway so I don't want to talk about this a lot, but there was a Dot a while ago and What I found more interesting as usual than the article were the comments about the article.

303
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,330
Rym: But the article was talking about it raised the question Why don't MMOs allow easier transportation?

304
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,037
Rym: and it talks a lot about how.

305
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:29,803
Rym: in MMOs You pretty much have to point your guy in a direction and he walks and walks and walks and walks and walks And then you get somewhere.

306
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:35,919
Rym: and the arguments on one side were that if you let people teleport everywhere Then the world feels too small.

307
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:50,379
Rym: but then people counter-argued by saying that no the world feels small because you have to walk through these desolate wastelands where there's nothing interactive anywhere along the way and It's a complex issue and I'm not sure I don't think there's a good answer yet, but MMOs suck

308
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:53,417
Scott: Well said.

309
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:55,105
Scott: But

310
00:19:55,125 --> 00:20:24,172
Rym: now in the comments what I found interesting was that most of the people who were Arguing against the question of why don't we who were saying we shouldn't make it easier We're making these really kind of weird like reflective Like there were arguments that only made sense Inside of the context of the MMOs that they played like they would argue that like something in the game like, you know Well, we don't need to make transportation faster because the game already did it.

311
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:28,328
Rym: if you get this trinket in this trinket and this mount The mount flies 50% faster than normal.

312
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,618
Rym: You can get there in like four minutes instead of eight.

313
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,148
Rym: Therefore we don't need to make it any faster.

314
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:39,399
Rym: and it's like what kind of person makes an argument like that Person is only thinking inside the box.

315
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,022
Scott: I mean quote.

316
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,752
Rym: then they added the Burning Crusade expansion with flying mounts.

317
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:51,873
Rym: the level 40 mounts dropped to 60 gold Level 60 mounts dropped to blah blah blah blah blah blah trying to skip ahead to the part that matters For a 60% flying speed mount.

318
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:56,151
Rym: Wow, never mind I picked the wrong wall of text to read and it ends with.

319
00:20:56,412 --> 00:21:01,077
Rym: you could boost these numbers by a further 10% if you get the right trinkets and equip them.

320
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:05,876
Scott: Uh-huh, and that is the argument against making travel faster in MMOs.

321
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:10,617
Scott: I Think the thing is I think you know fallout actually did a pretty good job of.

322
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:11,280
Scott: you know.

323
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,846
Scott: You walk somewhere the first time you want to go there and that forces you to you know Explore the map and think the thing.

324
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:26,829
Scott: the map and fallout, you know while it wasn't as extensive as an MMO map It was pretty big and there was actually stuff all over the place Even if a lot of it was sort of repetitive stuff.

325
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,580
Scott: there was stuff everywhere to explore, you know.

326
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:46,002
Scott: I think actually half-life 2 had a better mat Transportation in terms of exploring, you know Even though it was linear because like you're driving down the road in your little dune buggy and you see a house off to the side You can go and fully explore that house or you can keep going, you know, and I think you know the

327
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,245
Rym: the feel

328
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:52,139
Scott: of exploring a big world and finding actual stuff in it is in itself fun,

329
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,380
Rym: but

330
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:57,958
Scott: Once you get somewhere once I've already made a trip, right?

331
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,229
Scott: That why should I make the same trip again?

332
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,180
Scott: If nothing along that road has changed?

333
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,670
Scott: Well one argument might be an alternative road.

334
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:11,412
Rym: one argument is that there are you there's some Game-breaking mechanics that could come into play.

335
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:14,224
Rym: where say you can teleport anywhere You've already been.

336
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:20,698
Rym: then maybe you can use that to get away from someone who hasn't been somewhere yet immediately Instead of them having to chase you stuff like that.

337
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:30,700
Scott: Well, I mean obviously you I mean think about this right like in fallout 3 If there are bad guys about you can't quick walk you have to get rid of them first.

338
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:43,291
Scott: So if someone's after me and there's like a bad guy chasing me I can't teleport while the bad guys chasing me either got I got to fight it or get away from it So that it's no longer chasing me and then I can teleport, you know It's a simple fix.

339
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:44,240
Scott: It's already been implemented.

340
00:22:44,982 --> 00:23:01,510
Rym: Remember look at a non MMO like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and just remember that the thing where you just had a map you picked where you wanted to go and it would kind of interrupt your automatic travel periodically and show you a little cutscene a little random interaction and What I think should make an MMO awesome.

341
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:10,697
Rym: why MMOs could be so awesome would be those weird interactions where you're traveling somewhere and you meet someone on the road or you find something along the way.

342
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:14,267
Rym: that's interesting but I think the problem is that the MMO is just.

343
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:16,093
Scott: you're holding down one arrow and just walking.

344
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:20,045
Rym: the MMO that everyone plays World of Warcraft Doesn't have that.

345
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,540
Rym: you're not going to run into anything you want to run into on your way somewhere.

346
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,689
Rym: You might just have to fight some annoying bad guys or you're on your way to a raid You don't want to be late or you're just bored.

347
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:38,809
Rym: and everyone I know who plays World of Warcraft always They'll like I see them they'll set their character to auto run somewhere and they're like watching a movie in a window or playing But Joel or something.

348
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,097
Scott: they got Twitter and Wow.

349
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:44,432
Rym: now I hear That that's not worse than bejeweled so I can't talk about it.

350
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:49,259
Rym: No whenever something like that happens I can't talk about it unless it's worse than the last thing that happened.

351
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:52,299
Rym: I haven't talked about Jack Thompson in a long long time.

352
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,389
Scott: There's nothing to say about Jack Thompson a long long time.

353
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:56,640
Rym: Yes, and with Wow bejeweled isn't Wow.

354
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,676
Rym: Nothing that gay could add to Wow would make me talk about that.

355
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:01,037
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,811
Scott: Yeah I think the thing is there's other good things to consider right?

357
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:07,480
Scott: For example, let's say you could teleport everywhere, right?

358
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:10,200
Scott: Well, if you could teleport everywhere you'd save a lot of time.

359
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,494
Scott: I mean how many hours does someone spend typing but then so early?

360
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:14,398
Scott: some said walking.

361
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:27,620
Scott: therefore They're gonna complete quests faster and complete levels faster and they're gonna get ahead in the game faster Which means they're gonna reach the maximum in the game faster They're gonna get bored with the game faster and they're gonna close their account sooner.

362
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:36,735
Scott: Yep, and so when there's an MMO at any game that charges you monthly They want you to spend a lot of time playing.

363
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:45,134
Scott: they want to make it you know take as long as possible to get ahead in the game because Then you will you know think they got it.

364
00:24:45,174 --> 00:25:00,280
Scott: They have this careful psychological balance of make it so that it takes you a long time to play so that you'll stay subscribed for many months, but also Constantly reward you so that you're constantly enjoying yourself so that you will never get bored and want to stop playing.

365
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:17,740
Rym: I feel like the way the problem kind of everyone who addresses this problem in the questions Even in the article kind of looks at it from the wrong perspective that it wouldn't be an issue if the game were truly Truly massive as opposed to just a giant ready room where people move between these kind of instantiated encounters.

366
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:18,238
Scott: Yep

367
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:33,359
Rym: Because if it were truly massive You would be interacting with interesting things all the time and you'd be going places and the world would just be this organic evolving place Instead of this Static place that was just a kind of scenery between the two places you want it to be to do your next raid

368
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:36,750
Scott: that happens To have auction houses and shops and things of that nature.

369
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,035
Rym: Yeah, it is.

370
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:43,654
Rym: I guess this article just Not like you could in a lot of other MMOs.

371
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,240
Rym: no, I mean in the realm.

372
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,751
Rym: I had my house and we had our guild houses.

373
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:49,037
Rym: I had my bedroom.

374
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:51,286
Rym: I had that sword I've got I put on my wall.

375
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:53,114
Scott: I know you could get land in Ultima online.

376
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:56,679
Rym: Yeah, I had a garden So my own private garden.

377
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:07,472
Scott: Yeah, see like if someone if people could yes That's what I if I made an MMO the what I would do is I wouldn't you know I have like land for sale or anything stupid like that right is?

378
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:14,045
Scott: I would let people build, you know Like you go out you go into the you know There'd be a giant map you got.

379
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:19,025
Scott: you chop down some trees and you can build a log cabin just out and you know Wherever you want.

380
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:24,600
Scott: and then you know people who are Traveling around might come across your log cabin and knock on the door.

381
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,694
Scott: Maybe they steal all your shit and that'd be perfectly legitimate, you know, you know That's how it would be and it would be.

382
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,400
Scott: it would be very cool.

383
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:41,816
Scott: Maybe you could like, you know, you could build weird things just leave them out in in the world like you set up You know Maybe like skulls on sticks and you set up like a whole row of them in the woods somewhere.

384
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:44,828
Scott: if I can try to scare The shit out of people I point out you could.

385
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:50,595
Rym: you can have your little place in a kingdom of loathing Your little campsite, all right.

386
00:26:50,635 --> 00:27:05,577
Rym: Yeah Anyway, I don't know why I was diverged from its roots in some ways like it's diverged from a lot of the things that made Mucks and muds and mushes and moves interesting But it's basically stuck to the one thing that was bad about mine.

387
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:07,525
Scott: Well, it's not just wow I mean, there's a lot of games.

388
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,635
Scott: Well, I say well, you gotta walk to get some.

389
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:14,060
Rym: it's just like how you know In the beyond Dungeons and Dragons panel, we talk a lot about Dungeons and Dragons.

390
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,359
Rym: The everything we say applies to almost every role-playing game.

391
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:22,200
Rym: But everyone knows D&D everyone plays D&D everyone plays Wow, and now they're the same game.

392
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:31,055
Scott: So well thing is I've noticed that people, you know Whenever there's a talk about MMOs people always bring up like Eve online doesn't do.

393
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:32,860
Scott: that even lives the good one, you know.

394
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,189
Scott: Yeah, Eve online doesn't have all these problems.

395
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,900
Scott: Like Eve online is some great amazing game.

396
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:40,932
Scott: I see people playing Eve online, you know what they're doing.

397
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:47,975
Scott: instead of going and killing rats to level up They're going in mining asteroids to level up and get you know resources, right?

398
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:48,978
Scott: It's the same shit.

399
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:50,910
Rym: I was not the one who said it.

400
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:52,160
Rym: It was said long before me.

401
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,976
Rym: I'm not being original anyway, but Eve online is the greatest spreadsheet simulator.

402
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:58,120
Rym: The world has ever created.

403
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:04,319
Scott: So, you know all these people they're like, oh Eve online doesn't have these problems.

404
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,849
Scott: listen I saw a guy playing it.

405
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,119
Scott: He freaking had a ship.

406
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:11,739
Scott: He had to fly it all the way out somewhere which is the same thing as walking to get somewhere, right?

407
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:16,960
Scott: He had to mine asteroids and fly him back all slow like it's the same thing.

408
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,873
Rym: So things of the day I'm saving coconut monkey.

409
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,760
Rym: I'll wait till you all forget and I'll bring him up again.

410
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:37,620
Rym: I'm coconut out of nowhere But suffice it to say coconut monkey has neither arms nor legs, but my thing of the day is some footage from TIE fighter.

411
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:40,691
Rym: This is one of the cutscenes from the game and it's a spoiler.

412
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:52,959
Rym: I'm gonna tell you right now Admiral Harkov Betrays your Imperial ass and you catch him and you give him to Darth Vader and Darth Vader interrogates him in the episode 5 manner.

413
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,959
Rym: The fact that he basically like he.

414
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:59,307
Scott: Clearly just go on Star Wars.

415
00:28:59,568 --> 00:29:02,637
Rym: He clearly does not need the answer to the question.

416
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,440
Rym: He has asked this man.

417
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,096
Scott: Yeah, he could reread his mind.

418
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:10,271
Rym: He knows In Star Wars when he kills the Admiral he's like no.

419
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:15,087
Scott: but really go on YouTube and watch Videos of TIE fighter gameplay.

420
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:16,631
Scott: seriously, just go do it.

421
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:17,895
Scott: So search for TIE fighter.

422
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:18,497
Scott: You'll find it.

423
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:19,540
Rym: We'll link to something.

424
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,323
Scott: We'll link to some.

425
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,914
Scott: All right, my thing of the day.

426
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:27,086
Scott: So the day apparently at It might have been e3.

427
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:28,350
Scott: I don't know.

428
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:28,852
Scott: I didn't.

429
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:30,900
Scott: I watched this video the other day, but it's some gay.

430
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,980
Scott: There were some Italian guys and they were actually protesting because Mario was such a bad Italian stereotype.

431
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:42,480
Scott: You know, it's sort of like when those people were complaining that Resident Evil 5 was racist.

432
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:45,320
Scott: You know same kind of thing and you know, they're kind of right.

433
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,760
Scott: It's kind of surprising that you know, nobody's really complained about you know, the racistness of Mario.

434
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:57,563
Scott: I mean, I mean, come on, he's like It's all Come on.

435
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:05,727
Scott: I mean and no one seems to care about this, you know, it's like if Mickey Mouse was like, you know Like I am the French Mickey Mouse.

436
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:09,499
Scott: Oh, I can't even do French and Mickey Mouse at the same time.

437
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,304
Scott: Yeah, how do you do?

438
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:12,770
Scott: How do you do that?

439
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,935
Scott: And also be home?

440
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:15,160
Rym: I don't think it's possible.

441
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:17,779
Scott: Anyway, you know people would be like what the fuck is this shit?

442
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:23,612
Rym: You know, there'd be a big complaints but no part of it is that Mario has been such an institution for so long.

443
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:28,628
Rym: and if anyone had made a Complaints in the early days when it was 8-bit.

444
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,475
Rym: Could they have been taken seriously?

445
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,860
Scott: No, I guess the answer is no.

446
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:35,780
Rym: And then as graphics got better, it was far too late to make a complaint.

447
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:42,578
Scott: But anyway, the thing about this video is not just that some guys were complaining about the racistness of Mario.

448
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:44,284
Scott: It's that It's.

449
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:45,640
Scott: it's pretty unbelievable.

450
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:50,293
Scott: It's like two internet videos joined into one because I mean that alone would be internet video right.

451
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:56,628
Scott: but an escaped gorilla Kidnaps their girlfriend while this video is being.

452
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,273
Scott: it's unbelievable.

453
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:00,599
Scott: And then they go and they rescue the girlfriend.

454
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:04,691
Scott: It's Unbelievable, you have to see this shit the hat and the mustache.

455
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:06,980
Rym: Oh my god the mushrooms.

456
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:21,158
Rym: - So anyway We came up with this show kind of out of nowhere because there was an article Somewhat recently that we both read independently.

457
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:30,677
Rym: We didn't talk about it and Scott brought it up and I remembered it and we realized this pretty much Makes for a very interesting Tuesday show and I can't believe we never talked about this before.

458
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,400
Rym: Yep, and maybe we did but I'm not gonna go through the archive.

459
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,423
Scott: Well, I think there was.

460
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:46,600
Scott: we did a show on griefing where we discussed many of the things that we will probably repeat ourselves In this show, but there is a very big difference between griefing and cheating and I think cheating does demand its own episode.

461
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:49,071
Scott: But let before we just dive into cheating.

462
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,020
Scott: Let's talk about this article here.

463
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:57,217
Rym: so a Loyola professor made a character in City of Heroes City of villains called Twixt

464
00:31:57,838 --> 00:31:58,360
Scott: Twixt and

465
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:14,380
Rym: He basically he seemed to play this game for fun, but also for academia And he in the course of play decided to engage in a number of so-called Breaching experiments where he would breach social mores that were not enforced by game logic.

466
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:22,960
Rym: It's basically the equivalent of doing a study where in the real world you get into an elevator the door closes and you face all The other people instead of facing the door.

467
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,600
Scott: Think about whenever an elevator right everyone in the elevator puts their faces towards the elevator door.

468
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:34,765
Scott: Right, if you get an elevator and you put your back to the door and look at all the people in the elevator They'll freak out do it.

469
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:35,247
Scott: It's fun.

470
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:35,728
Rym: Yep,

471
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,250
Scott: but

472
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:54,049
Rym: it's the idea that if there is some sort of Unenforceable or unenforced social moray or some sort of thing that is legal to do Possible to do easy to do and even beneficial to do that due to some societal unwritten restriction is never done you can cause all sorts of havoc by breaking it.

473
00:32:54,149 --> 00:33:05,625
Rym: and he uses these video games that have basically a Completely 100% fabricated made-up internet culture in them to see how Universal these concepts are.

474
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:13,820
Rym: and he basically and all I could think of reading this article was way back when we used to play What Jedi Knight Jedi Knight - yeah, which was on the quake 3 engine?

475
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:22,220
Rym: It was basically an FPS lightsaber game where he was an FPS But you also had lightsabers but Scott and I played it with each other a whole bunch and then we started playing online.

476
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:28,120
Rym: I remember every time we play it online I would run into a server and there'd be like 20 people all fighting with lightsabers.

477
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:29,064
Scott: It was only.

478
00:33:29,144 --> 00:33:41,548
Scott: it was only on the dual servers because there were servers where you could play the actual FPS But they're also servers where you would just have lightsabers duels and it was sort of like ricochet where two people would fight at A time and everyone else would just sort of be waiting.

479
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:44,220
Scott: Yeah, or maybe it would do like, you know round-robin tournament.

480
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,521
Scott: This

481
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:57,597
Rym: happened to me a few times even in these the kind of freewheeling servers where it'd be a melee but you know, everyone's ever is like ten people fighting all over the place and Someone would come in front of me and he'd stop and look at me and he'd do his little bow Like do you want to duel and I just kill him?

482
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:11,275
Rym: Yep, but in the duels it was even worse Like the game would start and both players like walking right up next to each other Lightsabers out and they'd both like duck in the counter-strike teabagging motion back away And I think some people would like look at.

483
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:11,900
Scott: they wouldn't duck.

484
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,659
Scott: They would look at the ground and then look back up again to make their character lean over.

485
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:23,010
Rym: Everyone would basically bow and there was all this sort of formalized unwritten Unenforced by the game logic culture in the game.

486
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,340
Scott: Yeah, I would just kill anyone who bowed immediately.

487
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,810
Rym: I think I win if someone bowed.

488
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:28,300
Rym: their head came off in a second.

489
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,620
Rym: I was banned from servers for that bike.

490
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:38,130
Scott: And the thing is if they you know when the next person, you know thing is if you did if you didn't bow People got pissed and they tried they'd really freak out on you.

491
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,795
Scott: I was all dark side.

492
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:40,699
Scott: I get him with my lightning.

493
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:41,833
Scott: Yeah, every like.

494
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:42,440
Scott: yes, right?

495
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:48,312
Rym: It was kind of broken that as long as you had good FPS and skills You could just run away from someone lightning them until they die.

496
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,840
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's basically nothing.

497
00:34:50,721 --> 00:35:00,480
Scott: The game we're talking about the game had sort of an unwritten Rule and people got really pissed if you broke this unwritten and this wasn't even like a glitch or anything.

498
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,370
Rym: This was just this rule that came out of nowhere that players Enforced on their own as best they could.

499
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,300
Rym: it didn't come from the game designers didn't come from the game world.

500
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:18,280
Rym: It came from nothing but the players and yet people would lose their shit If you didn't follow the arbitrary rules that weren't written down anywhere.

501
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:22,393
Scott: Now the thing is right as we're going to discuss this is we don't?

502
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,368
Scott: I do not consider this and I would argue that It is not cheating right.

503
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,880
Scott: killing someone while they're bowing isn't cheating.

504
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,409
Rym: It's no different than killing someone while they're typing.

505
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:31,890
Rym: and you know what?

506
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:34,720
Rym: if I see that flag in quake 3 that means you're typing.

507
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:42,813
Rym: that is a beacon for a railgun to the head and Basically the argument here right is what is cheating right?

508
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:43,455
Rym: Oh, I didn't we?

509
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:45,160
Rym: I want to at least mention the rest of this article.

510
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:46,746
Scott: Oh, there's more to the article.

511
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:49,235
Rym: well very interesting because the the guy who did this.

512
00:35:49,315 --> 00:36:02,020
Rym: he did this in this MMO And he basically did what we did but he did it methodically and Such a way as to kind of catalog how people respond and reacted and all he would do was go into these PvP areas where?

513
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,865
Rym: Traditionally players wouldn't actually do the PvP like many versus many fights Which was to capture all these pillboxes.

514
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:17,064
Rym: the players would all kind of ignore each other even though they were enemies and farm XP uh-huh, or They would like fight.

515
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:33,686
Rym: these little duels like two of them would fight in like one corner of the map and all these people would Stand around and watch and he would join these matches and just proceed to win trivially so and he would use just intelligent basic strategy and Nothing against the rules.

516
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:34,310
Rym: No glitches.

517
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,200
Rym: He didn't even come close to using a glitch.

518
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,819
Rym: He did everything that was perfectly just within the scope of the game.

519
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:39,702
Scott: Well, that's it.

520
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:40,484
Scott: that's a case of.

521
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:49,312
Scott: you know basically by the definitions that I hold right those people right who everyone else But him was actually a griefer.

522
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,639
Scott: It's just they were all griefers.

523
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:59,431
Rym: Well the thing is what he discovered was that as he played this way people Like they went crazy to a degree that is laughable.

524
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,956
Rym: like he started he got death threats.

525
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:05,219
Rym: toward the end of this people Constantly made big petitions to get a band from the game.

526
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:14,520
Rym: They had got to the point where entire groups of people would just make alternate characters level them up all the way Attack him constantly and mass to try to force him off.

527
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,863
Rym: But because he used these basic strategies that they never apparently thought of he would beat them anyway Really?

528
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,228
Scott: Wow, it's that kind of game.

529
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:32,580
Rym: He basically just he by playing smartly could beat people Consistently and they could really do nothing about it because they refused to do what he did which was just basic strategy.

530
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:39,735
Rym: They thought that whatever that strategy was which had to do with teleporting people around the map Was unfair and against their social mores.

531
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:46,223
Rym: they refused to do it And they got mad when he did it and even the game designers basically sided with him saying look this part of the game deal With it.

532
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,240
Scott: Oh nice good game designers.

533
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:52,200
Rym: But the fact that like you should read the article to see all the details.

534
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:04,544
Rym: But basically he determined that humans will almost Immediately resort to the most brutal things they can possibly resort to to enforce their own personal arbitrary Social mores.

535
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:15,440
Rym: and if those mores are unenforceable by their own laws or by the laws of their society They will pretty much immediately do anything they can to circumvent those laws in order to enforce their own fake laws.

536
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:20,417
Rym: Yeah, and he makes some interesting conclusions and it's an interesting read.

537
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:23,346
Scott: Mm-hmm But how this relates to cheating right.

538
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:25,212
Scott: is that you know the discussion of?

539
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,020
Scott: is this guy cheating where the other people cheating?

540
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:34,039
Scott: You know what is cheating right and you know of course these these other guys right the guys who are getting killed there.

541
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:36,676
Scott: They would definitely argue that this guy was cheating.

542
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:37,320
Scott: no question.

543
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,014
Scott: They would argue that and there's a reason they are wrong and the reason is this right.

544
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:48,514
Scott: we did a show about griefing and Griefing was defined as you have someone playing a game right and they're not.

545
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:53,460
Scott: they're not breaking the rules of the game But what they're doing is they have a different goal, right?

546
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,085
Scott: So let's say we're playing Monopoly.

547
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:58,700
Rym: the game theory term is utility right different utility.

548
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,174
Scott: So we're playing Monopoly right and we're both mean remember both obeying the rules of Monopoly.

549
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:08,573
Scott: Rym wants to win at Monopoly So he wants to get the most money and he wants me to go bankrupt, right?

550
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,110
Scott: I don't want to win I don't care if I go bankrupt or not.

551
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:13,820
Scott: I just want to piss Rym off.

552
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,296
Scott: No, I just want to get as many houses as I can.

553
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:16,840
Scott: That's my goal.

554
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:18,458
Scott: You get a lot of houses, you know.

555
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:23,040
Scott: So I just buy as many houses I can and everybody hotels I get is you know?

556
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:33,939
Scott: And I just get as many properties I can but I don't really care about trying to get a lot of money You know and I just you know I'll be willing to spend like all this extra money to buy properties from you and get houses or whatever.

557
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:49,020
Rym: now We're basically playing two different games in the same space But my utility of the game as was laid forth and as people, you know Like the actual game as per the rules going toward the victory condition Is ruined by the fact that the people I'm playing with aren't going toward the written victory condition.

558
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,038
Scott: Yeah, so in the situation in the city of heroes villains, whatever, right?

559
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,764
Scott: There's a game of the you know Heroes versus villains.

560
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:01,722
Scott: kill all the heroes kill all the villains and this guy is playing that game and that's the utility He has.

561
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:05,320
Scott: apparently the game intends you to have but apparently no one else wants to play.

562
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:09,415
Scott: Other players have an alternate utility of get tons of XP or do whatever.

563
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:13,509
Scott: they'll tell they're doing So, you know, it's actually.

564
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:19,210
Scott: even though it would seem as if he was the griefer He's the one who's actually has the intended utility.

565
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:22,280
Scott: Therefore all the other players are griefers.

566
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,018
Rym: Well, of course the other interesting thing here is in the whole game theory, you know game theory.

567
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:32,580
Rym: nominally You can use it to determine what the best possible course of action is for a rational actor in a situation.

568
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:40,640
Rym: So the idea that you know I act in my own Best self-interest and I assume that everyone else is acting in their own best self-interest.

569
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:48,280
Rym: So I play games and I try to win said games and I don't cheat But I use whatever tools the game gives me to the best of my ability.

570
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:56,025
Rym: But a lot of people in a lot of competitive games if someone uses a strategy that is perfectly legitimate But that they perceive somehow is unfair.

571
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,051
Rym: They will basically accuse you of cheating.

572
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:10,480
Rym: Mm-hmm, even though you're following the rules completely and My entire life I have been one of those people to where if something works I will do it constantly and repeatedly until it is no longer work.

573
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,673
Scott: Yes, take for example the snaking in Mario Kart DS, right?

574
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,640
Rym: It makes it a worse game, but it's in there.

575
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,468
Rym: I cannot I cannot not do it.

576
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:23,160
Rym: Yes can a fire butt burn if there is brush before it?

577
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,252
Scott: So here's the thing with cheating.

578
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:29,972
Scott: right a game is Defined by its rules.

579
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,882
Scott: the rules of monopoly are Monopoly.

580
00:41:32,963 --> 00:41:36,155
Scott: if you have if you change even one rule, that's not monopoly.

581
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:37,420
Scott: That's some other game, right?

582
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,412
Scott: I mean you look and that's not to say that, you know, there.

583
00:41:40,453 --> 00:41:41,900
Scott: there's lots of complexity to that.

584
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:51,500
Scott: You know and look at something like baseball right the rules of baseball change a lot over time how they change Stadium to stadium right and you just you call it Major League Baseball.

585
00:41:51,620 --> 00:42:00,753
Scott: But really every different stadium American League National League every different year where the rules change Those are all actually different games.

586
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,340
Scott: a game is its rules.

587
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:14,852
Scott: So a cheater or cheating is when you you you declare yes I am playing this game, but you actually Break the rules in some way.

588
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:16,280
Scott: that's sort of obvious, right?

589
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:24,960
Scott: But if you accept the fact that a game is defined by its rules a cheater is actually someone Who they're not just breaking the rules, right?

590
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:29,659
Scott: They declare that they're playing one game, but they're actually playing a different game.

591
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:32,368
Scott: See a griefer is someone with a different utility.

592
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:35,156
Scott: a cheater is someone who's actually not playing.

593
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:38,028
Scott: they're doing something else But they're in your game.

594
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:46,862
Scott: So what this something else they're doing is Interacting with the game that you are playing in some way now, there's also the huge I've.

595
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:54,975
Rym: what amazes me is that I see people complaining that other people are cheating at Single-player games and I don't think there's even like.

596
00:42:54,995 --> 00:43:00,979
Rym: I don't think there is even any Discussion there if you own a game you should be able to you do whatever you want with it.

597
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:01,220
Rym: Okay?

598
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,913
Scott: Well, well the question of are they cheating yes or no, right?

599
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:06,680
Rym: Well, I don't think it even matters at that.

600
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,959
Scott: Well, I don't think it matters either.

601
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:10,369
Scott: But there is a question of are they cheating or not?

602
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:13,120
Scott: and I would say in a video game, right?

603
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,624
Scott: You look at a board game, right?

604
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:15,948
Scott: The rules are.

605
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:20,380
Scott: you know the game and cheating is breaking the rules or not playing a different game.

606
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:26,540
Scott: So if you do something that is contrary to what the rule book says then that is cheating, right?

607
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,800
Scott: But in a video game there isn't necessarily a comprehensive rule book.

608
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,639
Scott: I mean something like civilization 2 back in the day came with a big old rule book with all the rules in it.

609
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,171
Scott: But you know a modern video games don't come with dick for dick.

610
00:43:40,632 --> 00:43:43,040
Scott: Maybe they'll come with a PDF manual if you're lucky, right?

611
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:54,745
Scott: so the rules of a video game are the source code of the video game and Therefore if you do not modify the source code of the video game It is impossible.

612
00:43:54,845 --> 00:44:00,909
Scott: and the game, you know, this obviously cheat modes that are in the game, you know They're either labeled cheating.

613
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,922
Scott: So those are obviously a separate thing You know.

614
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,875
Rym: are they though because they're straight-up part of the game.

615
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:05,338
Rym: I can do it.

616
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:06,827
Scott: They are part of the game.

617
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,536
Rym: those got if you're going by that logic.

618
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:13,760
Rym: All right I don't have to modify the source code of counter-strike to use an aimbot.

619
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:19,560
Rym: In fact, I could use an aimbot that just watches what comes out of the game and then directs inputs into the game.

620
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:20,507
Scott: That is true.

621
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,020
Rym: Is that cheating then by your definition?

622
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:27,249
Scott: I would actually say it is not cheating But what it is is you are not actually playing.

623
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,937
Scott: some computer program is playing in your stead.

624
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,046
Scott: All right It's a completely different thing.

625
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:33,352
Scott: You're not cheating at the game.

626
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:34,940
Scott: You're not breaking the rules of the game.

627
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:36,627
Scott: What you're doing is you're not playing.

628
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,134
Scott: someone else is playing for you.

629
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:39,640
Scott: Some computer program is playing the game.

630
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:46,389
Scott: I would make the argument that at least if you make the argument that that no I mean bot is cheating then you have to also beat.

631
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:50,000
Scott: make the argument that just a bot is cheating if you play against bots.

632
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:56,120
Rym: No, what I would argue is that colloquially I think it is more useful to apply the broad term cheating to that situation.

633
00:44:56,802 --> 00:45:04,817
Rym: Perhaps because if someone if I'm playing quake 3 and I just have an aimbot or whatever I hit middle mouse it just puts the pointer on the head of the nearest person.

634
00:45:04,857 --> 00:45:06,848
Rym: in my sights That's cheating.

635
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:12,739
Scott: Oh Hey, if it's not modifying the source code of the game, you're not breaking the rules.

636
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:14,703
Rym: I Disagree with that.

637
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:15,946
Scott: You're just not playing.

638
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:18,253
Scott: some very good computer is playing instead of you.

639
00:45:18,374 --> 00:45:20,460
Rym: But Scott, I think it's a pointless distinction.

640
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,513
Scott: Yeah, I think it's a useful distinction now because part of it is that.

641
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:25,979
Rym: how is it actually useful though?

642
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,396
Scott: Well, because you're still playing quake 3 you're not you're not, you know doing anything.

643
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:36,397
Scott: That's like otherwise, you know If some guys rocketing around without taking damage when he should be that's cheating.

644
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:46,980
Rym: By the same token One of the implied ideas of playing a game like this, especially, you know A multiplayer online game is that you are the person you say you are that I am playing.

645
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:48,746
Rym: I am Rym Rym is playing.

646
00:45:49,027 --> 00:45:53,503
Rym: if I'm using an aimbot I am cheating and that I am saying that I am Rym But I'm not Rym.

647
00:45:53,945 --> 00:46:00,160
Scott: Well, you might be lying right and you know, you could not you know Legally attribute the victories and losses.

648
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:05,759
Rym: There's basically practically zero cheating in any multiplayer game in the world.

649
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:08,652
Scott: No, most cheating is modification of source code.

650
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:09,456
Scott: No, it really isn't.

651
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:10,019
Scott: Yeah, it is.

652
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:13,080
Rym: So what names and cheating then like all the counter-strike aimbots?

653
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,870
Scott: They you know, they they they they don't.

654
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,239
Scott: they don't work the way you you know.

655
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:18,692
Scott: They don't look at the screen and then move the mouse.

656
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,360
Rym: But how is that a useful distinction?

657
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,714
Scott: Because you're you're either breaking the rules of the game or you're not.

658
00:46:24,016 --> 00:46:27,992
Scott: it's you know It's something that looks at the screen and then moves the mouse.

659
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:34,540
Scott: It's not breaking the rules of the game It's not doing anything that is outside the bounds of what is allowed by the rule book.

660
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:37,610
Rym: Alright, so name a non FPS example of cheating.

661
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,420
Scott: then a non FPS example of cheating.

662
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:43,435
Rym: Yes Because I think your definition is so narrow as to be useless.

663
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:48,299
Scott: you play Yahtzee You roll the dice and then you just turn them all to six and you say look at video game.

664
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:54,397
Scott: Oh in a video game because this is where your definition I think breaks down a video game example of cheating.

665
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,220
Scott: That's not an FPS.

666
00:46:56,721 --> 00:47:00,252
Scott: You just give you you hack the game to give yourself like a million gold.

667
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:01,576
Scott: and who does that of a star?

668
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:02,960
Rym: competitive multiplayer games?

669
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,352
Rym: And a competitive multiplayer game because that's the only place for cheating matters.

670
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:08,556
Rym: you're cheating in a single-player game.

671
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:08,817
Rym: great.

672
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:12,064
Scott: Yeah Does it really happen?

673
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,560
Rym: and colloquially who is going to argue that an aimbot is not cheating?

674
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:18,454
Scott: Yeah, well, it depends on the most aim.

675
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:19,200
Scott: bots are cheating.

676
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,820
Scott: They're not using the non cheating method that you just describe.

677
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,809
Rym: It wouldn't be that hard to make an aimbot that just.

678
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,020
Rym: basically I have to change some arbitrary parameters.

679
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:30,260
Rym: It does the exact same thing and suddenly it's not cheating because of some semantic BS.

680
00:47:30,702 --> 00:47:32,150
Scott: No a name by the didn't cheat.

681
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,060
Scott: you need like a camera looking at your monitor.

682
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,844
Rym: No, not even that.

683
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:41,152
Rym: I could just and I could have a program that sits in like in line Analyzes what the video card is doing and then makes decisions.

684
00:47:41,714 --> 00:47:46,691
Rym: I'm not modifying the game I'm just reading the information the game has and they so it.

685
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:47,132
Scott: basically you're.

686
00:47:47,172 --> 00:47:49,620
Scott: yeah, you're just connecting the video output to the best input.

687
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,303
Rym: I'm not modifying the source code.

688
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:58,440
Rym: What if I have something that just reads all of the games RAM in real time and Then just gives me all this extra information from the RAM?

689
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,765
Rym: I'm not modifying anything.

690
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:02,093
Rym: The information is clearly available technologically.

691
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:02,574
Rym: the source code.

692
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:03,157
Rym: lets me read it.

693
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:06,700
Rym: Yeah So so there's basically nothing is cheating.

694
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,369
Rym: Yeah, so the definition is basically useless.

695
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:11,974
Scott: It's not useless.

696
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:13,157
Rym: I think it's useless.

697
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:17,369
Scott: No anyway Anyway, so the thing is right we talked about.

698
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:19,435
Scott: you know, cheating is breaking the rules of a game.

699
00:48:19,456 --> 00:48:22,186
Scott: and you see this guy He's playing a city of heroes.

700
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:25,360
Scott: He's not breaking the rules of the game in any way whatsoever.

701
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,119
Scott: Everything he does is perfectly in line with the rules of the game, you know, everything that he does is pretty.

702
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,586
Scott: no It's the game.

703
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:33,249
Scott: lets him do it.

704
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:35,720
Rym: Yeah, I just think I think your extreme example is useless.

705
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,500
Rym: I mean a good example of this I think would be I used to play weapons factory.

706
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,980
Rym: You know, there was the successor to Team Fortress.

707
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:43,367
Rym: It was the quake 2 mod versus capture.

708
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,212
Rym: the flag classes recalls all that stuff.

709
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:49,585
Rym: and there used to be flash grenades And they were great.

710
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:51,050
Rym: They were too great.

711
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:53,800
Rym: They blinded you for like 20 seconds.

712
00:48:53,941 --> 00:48:56,977
Rym: That's way too long and I care you could carry like 15 of them at a time.

713
00:48:57,741 --> 00:49:01,899
Rym: That's just the problem with game being bad and the recon could fly but people didn't really use them that much.

714
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:07,373
Rym: So one day I'm bass ackwards one of my favorite maps me and my friend Ken.

715
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:12,740
Rym: we decided hey, let's win the game Let's just win this game for the clan.

716
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:14,888
Rym: So what we did is we were both recon's.

717
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,060
Rym: we flew to the enemy base and in the enemy base was the flag thing.

718
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,365
Rym: But we didn't even bother capping.

719
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:22,157
Rym: There was also a button hidden in the wall.

720
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:22,900
Rym: That was known.

721
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,604
Rym: It was part of the map.

722
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:26,460
Rym: You could hit this button and is the equivalent of a field goal.

723
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:29,660
Rym: So you'd get you know, like a hundred two hundred points for capturing the flag.

724
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:42,160
Rym: You'd get like three points if you hit this button and you could hit it every like 30 seconds In the enemy base, it was basically the tiebreaker, you know, I can't catch the flag, but I run in here and hit this button.

725
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:43,118
Scott: Oh, that's pretty good.

726
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:49,280
Rym: We went in there and we had an engineer outside who basically provided us with ammo forever.

727
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:56,439
Rym: He was hiding and I flew around the top dropping a flash bomb every 20 seconds.

728
00:49:56,782 --> 00:50:13,780
Rym: very meanwhile Ken would swoop down hit the button and Then every minute or so we'd switch it up and then we'd periodically swap out and one of us go get ammo and come back And we basically kept the entire enemy team blind and stupid for the entire map and we won on nothing but field goals.

729
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:14,667
Scott: There you go.

730
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:18,780
Rym: I was Banned from a couple servers for it.

731
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:24,878
Rym: I was hated forever and not that long after they ended up removing flash from the game.

732
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:28,060
Scott: There you go See, I mean, you know, there are many games that have problems.

733
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,560
Scott: I mean that's directly in line with you know, the the snaking in Mario Kart DS, right?

734
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,985
Scott: It's something that you know, you know, even if you might call it a glitch right the minus world in Mario one or something Something that was not intended.

735
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:43,880
Scott: right it, you know, there are plenty of games out there that have bad rules.

736
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,220
Scott: I mean look at you know stuff in like D&D third edition, you know, they wrote it right into the rule book.

737
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:50,260
Scott: You got the 10-foot reach and the whole thing.

738
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,999
Scott: You could hit him and take a step back and hit him and take a step back and they can't hit you.

739
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:56,028
Rym: Well, this is the real situation.

740
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:58,860
Rym: they could the conflation between cheating and just being good at a game.

741
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:08,079
Rym: Yeah, because I've been kicked from servers in the past and so is Scott and I'm sure a lot of you have Before being accused of cheating when in fact, no, I was just really good.

742
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:12,880
Rym: I mean, I've gotten headshots that were improbable, but they were legitimate headshots.

743
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:36,240
Rym: I was kicked for being in anybody even though I wasn't but Especially with games that involve that are complex or games that involve there when there were many different strategies You can employ a lot of times, you know A smart player will identify the most effective strategies and if there is a strategy that is greatly more effective than any other strategy You're a fool to not use it in my opinion because now you're basically violating your own utility.

744
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,112
Rym: You're breaking your cognitive dissonance of.

745
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:39,279
Rym: you could win.

746
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:49,676
Rym: It's like playing poker and you have a royal flush, but you decide it's unfair that you have a royal flush So you decide to fold anyway, yeah, or you don't go all-in.

747
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:50,640
Rym: you say you know what?

748
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,366
Rym: I'm not gonna go all-in cuz that's mean.

749
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:55,035
Scott: Well, it's it's you know, it's that's not cheating.

750
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,520
Scott: It's what's called cheap, right?

751
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,419
Scott: People think it's cheap.

752
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:57,580
Scott: Well,

753
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:11,740
Rym: no, that's what I'm saying that that's the much more interesting argument that people perceive things as being unfair in games But oftentimes what they perceive as being unfair is just a strategy They're unwilling or unable to employ that is far more effective than the one that they themselves employ.

754
00:52:12,322 --> 00:52:25,620
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing is if a game has a cheap strategy available And the reason a strategy is cheap right is not just because it's extremely effective and you win It's also because it's relatively trivial to employ.

755
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:32,300
Scott: I mean really people don't have a problem if there's a game that has a very powerful strategy that is difficult to employ.

756
00:52:32,822 --> 00:52:33,544
Rym: Look at snaking.

757
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:35,972
Scott: snaking on it's not that difficult.

758
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:38,945
Rym: It was difficult on any but there were a few maps It was easy on.

759
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:44,112
Scott: but it's much more difficult to say Hit all of the shortcuts with precise timing.

760
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:46,943
Scott: that it is to snake down the straightaways You know.

761
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:54,488
Scott: yet going down all the shortcuts with the precise timing is much more difficult than staking down the straightaways You know, so it's a matter of.

762
00:52:54,629 --> 00:53:05,394
Rym: but if if a strategy is so trivial then everyone could do it So that means that someone is choosing not to use an optimal obvious strategy, of course I mean look at an example of having no cheapness right.

763
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:06,900
Scott: look at what do we play?

764
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,924
Scott: We just played power grid.

765
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:08,225
Scott: right.

766
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,020
Scott: and power grid, you know, some power plants are better than others.

767
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:14,769
Scott: But the better power plants are more expensive.

768
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:20,064
Scott: that the awesome fusion power plant is minimum $50 50 electro.

769
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:27,551
Scott: Sorry, right if the 50, you know if the fusion power plant was one electro It would be cheap.

770
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:28,660
Scott: It wouldn't be cheating.

771
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,919
Scott: It would just be a bad game that had these cheap and effect, you know effective things in it.

772
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:41,600
Scott: So if a game has something that could be considered cheating, you know some strategy that just dominates that's trivial to employ.

773
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,993
Scott: Yeah, and people consider it cheating, but it's not.

774
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:46,340
Scott: it's perfectly in line with the rules.

775
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:49,359
Scott: It's just a bad game that has cheap things in it.

776
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:49,652
Scott: well

777
00:53:49,740 --> 00:54:04,380
Rym: one thing I do I do find interesting is that the thing that people that Cheating is pretty much come down to online as far as I can see what people complain about the most and say is cheating the most Are people who buy gold or gold farm or use bots to get experience in MMOs?

778
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:13,480
Rym: It seems like that is the the quote unquote Cheating that most of the internet is most in an uproar about even though I don't consider it cheating.

779
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:18,236
Scott: Yeah well that is one problem I have with MMOs and some other games online.

780
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:24,060
Scott: a lot is They like to enforce a lot of rules outside of the source code, right?

781
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:33,591
Scott: Like, you know, for example I remember reading something way back in the early days of Wow about some people who were like able to get up on the roofs Of some buildings and then shoot people from above and they couldn't.

782
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:40,868
Scott: no one could shoot back and they killed a bunch of people from Above right and and then they got banned or something It's like your code.

783
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:43,000
Scott: let them get up on the roof and let them do that.

784
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,452
Scott: They weren't?

785
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:43,760
Scott: you know?

786
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,600
Rym: They didn't hack the game plus stuff like that brings forth some of the coolest and most fun things in MMOs.

787
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:58,131
Rym: The best memories I have are when someone figured out something crazy you could do and then the game world went crazy for a few Days until the admins like wait a minute.

788
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:07,489
Rym: Okay, something's going on here But rather than banning all the people involved the best way to handle it was to do something clever Or equally clever to fix it, you know.

789
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,858
Rym: say people are getting on the roofs and doing something like that.

790
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:20,877
Scott: Introduce some monsters that fly around and eat people on the roofs or maybe Let them fix it So that people on the ground can shoot back or fix this and no one get on the roofs anymore.

791
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:25,971
Scott: or you know Don't go doing you know, just bullshit just smacking people down for being awesome.

792
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:30,783
Rym: or look at the the ever famous the the murder of Lord British Exactly.

793
00:55:30,803 --> 00:55:33,600
Rym: That was one of the most epic moments in MMOs ever.

794
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:37,238
Rym: I mean, I still know people who to this day are like I was there.

795
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:48,935
Rym: I was there when Lord British died and it was crazy and the internet went nuts about it and it was super awesome and They basically reacted to it in the absolute worst possible way.

796
00:55:49,237 --> 00:55:54,560
Rym: if they'd been cool They would have just made the game world be like, all right, Lord British is dead.

797
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:57,539
Rym: You assholes brought this on yourselves.

798
00:55:58,142 --> 00:56:01,634
Rym: Yeah made bad shit happen and then they could have had some sort of cool story arc.

799
00:56:01,654 --> 00:56:03,817
Scott: and then Lord British is keeping out the bad guys.

800
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:10,640
Rym: Have Lord British come back or have some like gigantic final quest in the game to bring him back from the dead?

801
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,907
Rym: You know some be British.

802
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:17,040
Rym: you can sum it up pretty simply solve in-game problems in-game.

803
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:21,560
Rym: Don't solve them out of game because all you do is make your game crap.

804
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:27,120
Scott: Yep, and likewise it goes in the reverse direction right looking like some house rules like Monopoly.

805
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,020
Scott: We always talk about the free parking and the money in the middle, right?

806
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,130
Scott: If you even know everyone agrees to do that, don't do that.

807
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,615
Scott: You're all cheating all of you.

808
00:56:36,076 --> 00:56:37,300
Scott: everyone in the game is cheating.

809
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:43,820
Rym: Can you call it cheating if all the players in a game agree to a set of rules and a set of utility?

810
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:44,721
Scott: Well, yes You.

811
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:48,940
Scott: if you don't want to call it cheating you at least have to agree that you're not playing Monopoly you're playing something.

812
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:51,693
Rym: I think it's just a semantic point at that.

813
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:52,538
Scott: I think it's important.

814
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:57,300
Scott: I don't think it matters because you get young because you get someone will come up and be like, oh, I'm so great at Monopoly.

815
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,868
Scott: It's like yeah, let's put some money in the middle way.

816
00:56:58,908 --> 00:57:00,154
Scott: You're not playing monopolies here.

817
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:03,350
Scott: You're great at something else You know, you're great at being lucky at landing.

818
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:05,240
Scott: every parking is what you're great at, you know.

819
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,980
Rym: But that somehow without that monopoly is still a skill based game.

820
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:10,899
Scott: I didn't say monopoly is skill based game.

821
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:17,020
Scott: Monopoly is just a real example because a good example for this kind of stuff because people know the rules of it and how it Works generally.

822
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,833
Rym: I mean the only problem I see there and it's always solved socially.

823
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:27,873
Rym: if you play with people and some people Don't know the rules because they've been playing the game wrong and you either don't play with those people Force them to play the right rules agree to a house rule.

824
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:28,860
Rym: That's not really a concern.

825
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,362
Scott: Well, it's not.

826
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:30,326
Scott: I mean cheating.

827
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:35,004
Scott: the thing is, you know people tend to think of cheating is something that just you know Makes the ruins the game.

828
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:45,660
Scott: I think there's a lot of cheating that isn't a concern, but it's still cheating, you know, semantically speaking You know like take for example this right you look we were talking the other day about jigaboo Jones.

829
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:48,172
Scott: Right, you know the guy who can pretty much.

830
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:57,974
Scott: if you give him two casino dice He can roll whatever the hell he wants Right, and we talked about well if you're playing burning wheel right nowhere in the burning wheel rule book Does it really explicitly say that?

831
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:05,087
Scott: You know, I mean look at craps as very specific rules about rolling the dice has to bounce so many times It has to hit the opposite wall right.

832
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,120
Scott: burning wheel doesn't really specify how the dice had to be rolled.

833
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,071
Scott: It just says roll dice.

834
00:58:09,597 --> 00:58:13,572
Scott: So jigaboo Jones playing burning wheel could make just sixes show up.

835
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:22,072
Scott: you could roll one dice get a six to show up every time Use a fate point and basically roll in a million successes and He would win whatever he wanted to.

836
00:58:22,636 --> 00:58:28,118
Scott: and you know This question of is it cheating came up for him to do that and there's a couple of valid arguments.

837
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,540
Scott: one Is that there's sort of this implication that when you roll the dice?

838
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,980
Scott: You're supposed to roll them and it should be random and that jigaboo Jones is clearly not random.

839
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,524
Scott: He's just.

840
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:38,499
Scott: you know, he can fix dice because he has skills.

841
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:39,442
Scott: The.

842
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:42,331
Scott: the other argument was you know burning wheel?

843
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:44,839
Scott: really it's like sure get all successes.

844
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:46,846
Scott: occasionally You're gonna want some failures.

845
00:58:46,886 --> 00:58:50,660
Scott: You're actually you know, in some ways you're making the game worse for yourself.

846
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:58,060
Scott: You're not really, you know, you can't make the game better by fixing the results of the dice You're just making the game well different.

847
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,680
Rym: What came out of that conversation to me was this whole you could make an interesting game.

848
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:15,472
Rym: I like the idea now of some sort of Role-playing game where the system for resolving conflicts is some sort of game of strength and or dexterity Mmm, some sort of like maybe a Mario Party minigame.

849
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:20,900
Scott: you play pick-up sticks to determine who wins a duel of it Something like that something you could practice outside again.

850
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,167
Rym: I just have this vague concept of you could.

851
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:26,317
Rym: I think you could make something strange and unique and interesting.

852
00:59:26,357 --> 00:59:27,100
Scott: What's the game from?

853
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:30,845
Scott: Prince of Nothing Bajunka.

854
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,004
Scott: you could play some bajunka Or you could like how about?

855
00:59:34,105 --> 00:59:38,720
Scott: you know, you could like lay a ghost stone and you know as part of the game something like that.

856
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:48,160
Rym: Well in that case it really just comes down to Blue crane in writing burning wheel did not even consider the possibility of someone learning how to toss dice.

857
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:53,333
Rym: Nope, so if you asked him you would probably say yeah, that's pretty stupid.

858
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:59,011
Rym: if you do that and that you know you enforce that Socially, which is just what they did against the guy.

859
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:04,798
Scott: but right but isn't enforcing that socially Basically the same as getting the guys off the roof?

860
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:10,040
Scott: and Wow You're socially enforcing a rule rather than you know, putting it in the code or in the rule book?

861
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:13,239
Rym: Yep it is and that's why you house rules come down to.

862
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:17,494
Rym: everyone agrees to the rules and you don't play with people who don't agree with the rules.

863
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:23,719
Rym: if you're playing D&D and you have all these beer and pretzels house rules as long as everyone in the game is aware of and agrees to them, that's great.

864
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:34,899
Rym: and The problem with an MMO is that the only rules everyone agreed to when they played are the rules that are the source code and the rules in the TOS.

865
01:00:36,226 --> 01:00:41,700
Rym: so as a result You you can't unless you're violating one of those two things directly.

866
01:00:42,162 --> 01:00:56,133
Rym: You're not really violating the social contract as far as I see because in MMO The coolest thing about MMOs is that they're a microcosm of the real world and in the real world Say I'm country a and I want to do something and country B wants to stop me.

867
01:00:56,896 --> 01:01:03,599
Rym: if I have a bigger army than country A there's no game master to say hey, you can't invade country B. I just do it.

868
01:01:04,062 --> 01:01:17,240
Rym: Yep, and I like the idea that If you want to enforce non written rules in an MMO or a game like that You have to enforce them in the game within the context of the game.

869
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:23,500
Rym: So the whole let's all get together and beat him, you know gang up on him South Park style is a fantastic response.

870
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:26,280
Rym: The fact that they couldn't beat him was just hilarious.

871
01:01:29,246 --> 01:01:31,425
Rym: Yeah, yeah And burning wheel.

872
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:33,874
Rym: it just comes down to the fact that everyone in the group agrees.

873
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:39,453
Rym: if if you learned how to toss sixes And you can reliably toss sixes and you didn't agree to using a dice cup.

874
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:41,420
Rym: We just kick you out of our burning wheel game.

875
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:44,633
Scott: Yeah, there's other things, you know, there's nothing you know.

876
01:01:44,653 --> 01:01:45,778
Scott: dice cup isn't you know?

877
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,860
Scott: Not allowed by the rules you could definitely force people to use cheating.

878
01:01:50,261 --> 01:01:50,602
Rym: It's all.

879
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:55,639
Rym: I would say that realistically something is only cheating if it is a is either.

880
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:03,522
Rym: again It's against the stated accepted rules of the game that have been agreed to by all players in the game Mm-hmm.

881
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,788
Scott: Yeah, there's also something to think about.

882
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:12,614
Scott: right as you look at something like say D&D right where it is There's nominally this game master who decides the rules.

883
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:17,500
Rym: the best game masters Just make shit up all the time in D&D because you have to so right.

884
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,360
Scott: So but they make all this shit up or they maybe they enforce rules that aren't even in the book and all this stuff.

885
01:02:22,963 --> 01:02:25,979
Scott: Are they game masters in a way cheating you see?

886
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,179
Rym: Well in a game like that it again comes down to What's the most enjoyable experience for the players?

887
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,263
Rym: Mm-hmm as a whole.

888
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:39,808
Rym: there's also to consider, you know any consent of everyone playing under a game master Implicitly agrees to the.

889
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:43,746
Rym: you know, however that they got game master style of play Whatever he does.

890
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:46,400
Rym: That's why I'm playing in his game and not Joey Jojo's game.

891
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:51,880
Scott: There's also stuff to think about like referees right like look at basketball or or soccer.

892
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,828
Scott: There's a you know, certain sports or hockey.

893
01:02:54,868 --> 01:02:59,380
Scott: There's a lot of subjective rules, you know, maybe the ref didn't see the hook.

894
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:02,469
Scott: Maybe you know the ref thinks that's a foul.

895
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,693
Scott: It wasn't a friend then.

896
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:06,040
Rym: that's a metagame and that is part of the game.

897
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,960
Rym: I mean a valid strategy in hockey is hit him when the refs not looking.

898
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:11,387
Scott: It's a very good strategy.

899
01:03:11,427 --> 01:03:12,371
Scott: hit him when the refs not looking.

900
01:03:12,472 --> 01:03:14,080
Rym: and again things like that.

901
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:17,010
Rym: Or were some of the greatest most amazing moments in gaming and sports.

902
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,080
Rym: and everything come from where someone pulls the crazy trick play.

903
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,249
Rym: That was technically correct.

904
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:22,812
Rym: Technically.

905
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:33,566
Rym: Okay the best kind of okay Mmm, and in video games the same thing, you know when someone pulls off some crazy stunt that no one thought was possible and kills Lord British how awesome is that?

906
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:43,220
Rym: and then just respond to it in an intelligent and equally clever way and everything works out in the Well, how about like, you know, do you actually cheat and anything ever?

907
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,117
Rym: I've the only game I cheat at and I still cheat at it to this day.

908
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:47,780
Scott: is you correct?

909
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:49,870
Rym: It's Euchre because Euchre is a stupid get.

910
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,894
Rym: Euchre is a memorized game.

911
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:52,100
Rym: I'm a perfect Euchre player.

912
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,578
Rym: It's not hard to be a perfect Euchre player.

913
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:59,140
Rym: So the real game is how much table talk and you get away with before you're called on it.

914
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:00,847
Rym: How much can you stack the deck?

915
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:02,072
Rym: and in high school?

916
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:03,519
Rym: We played Euchre very pointedly.

917
01:04:04,061 --> 01:04:06,556
Rym: Everyone was constantly trying to cheat.

918
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,187
Rym: Oh Directly they were trying to stack the deck.

919
01:04:09,207 --> 01:04:12,960
Rym: They're trying to slip cards around and that in itself was the game.

920
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:21,049
Rym: We we were playing a game where we agreed that everyone was going to try to cheat to the best of their ability Mm-hmm, and it was super awesome as a result.

921
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:26,588
Scott: Well, how about like when I was playing citadels that one time and Basically, I took the cards.

922
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,175
Scott: I would pick a roll.

923
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:30,002
Scott: I would hand them to you Unshuffled.

924
01:04:30,223 --> 01:04:36,160
Scott: you would fan them out and select one and I all had to do is look at them while you fanned them and select.

925
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,280
Scott: Now I remembered what order they were in when I handed them to you.

926
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:43,160
Rym: I do not consider that cheating because again extent meta information.

927
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:43,822
Rym: It's one thing.

928
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:48,440
Rym: if I look over your screen and teeny and see your time that is clearly cheating.

929
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:59,460
Rym: But if I have not moved myself in any way I'm Sitting unmoving with blinders on and you happen to get up and knock your screen over and I see that you have no red tiles.

930
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:03,019
Rym: I'm pretty much obligated to use that information against you.

931
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:05,487
Scott: Yeah, but doesn't it in also some way?

932
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:14,040
Scott: it's not necessarily cheating because it wasn't your intent action to break the rules But the rules are sort of broken by accident in the same time.

933
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,259
Scott: It's almost like a game glitch.

934
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:26,726
Scott: So even though if you have cannot be blamed for the cheating and you of course would have to be expected to act on this information you could in a Justifiably asterisk the game.

935
01:05:26,786 --> 01:05:33,120
Rym: but the real answer is if anything happens at all you have to ask her as the game You could keep playing or not, but the game is immediately asterisk.

936
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:39,120
Rym: But at the same time the asterisk comes automatically because I can't unsee what has been seen.

937
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:44,936
Rym: Of course you cannot unsee and I cannot act as though I have not seen because I have seen.

938
01:05:44,956 --> 01:05:48,309
Rym: I cannot discount the Information because the information is there.

939
01:05:48,832 --> 01:05:55,800
Rym: and even if I tried to discount it Like maybe I would have attacked even though I didn't know what your cards were.

940
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,869
Rym: Maybe I had a 60% chance now.

941
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:00,200
Rym: I have a hundred percent chance, you know that sort of thing.

942
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:08,290
Rym: And also the situation where I used to do this a lot to you where if you would always stack your tiles up in T&E Behind your screen.

943
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:11,918
Rym: I couldn't see the tiles But I noticed that you've ever had a stack of three or more.

944
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:20,540
Rym: When you were going for cut tiles of that color you would reach at it from the top with your fingers But if it was a small stack of like one you would come at it from the side.

945
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:29,276
Rym: It was the subconscious thing and it was reliable and I used it to great effect because it was always right and I would always Know if you had three or less of a tile.

946
01:06:29,578 --> 01:06:32,880
Rym: Yeah And eventually you stop doing that because I pointed it out.

947
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,876
Rym: But I don't think that was cheating any more than reading someone's poker tell is cheating.

948
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:41,705
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, but it's straight, you know It's like all these sort of meta game.

949
01:06:41,806 --> 01:06:54,036
Scott: things right can help you do things in the game that you're not breaking any rules Of the game, but in a way you are breaking the intent of the game, you know It's like the game intends for that information to be secret.

950
01:06:54,438 --> 01:06:59,621
Scott: yet You are discovering that information by accident or by on purpose

951
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,126
Rym: at the same time through means

952
01:07:01,206 --> 01:07:02,450
Scott: that are not breaking anything

953
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:13,966
Rym: much more real-world scenario because in the real world there is all this extent information and an intelligent person cannot ignore extent information and Succeed reliably over time.

954
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:18,320
Rym: Mm-hmm, and you're doing yourself a disservice to ignore extent information.

955
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:21,060
Rym: I use that word a lot when we play board games.

956
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:25,535
Rym: Scott has a terrible difficulty in keeping all of it together in some games.

957
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,220
Scott: Well, let's talk about right.

958
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,860
Scott: What do you do if you're playing a game right and I say a board game just because it's more of a social

959
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:33,540
Rym: And I fuck up on my own and no one knows

960
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:39,860
Scott: No, and there's someone who's actually like a cheater like you go to a convention and there's someone who's like, you know They're trying to cheat to win.

961
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,295
Rym: it's very very simple and I use this policy universally.

962
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:51,307
Scott: if I'm playing a board game and Someone cheats like actually cheating like there is monopoly and they're just taking money out of the bank And I catch them cheating.

963
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:56,657
Rym: I call them on it immediately with proof And if they don't admit to it, I end the game and died.

964
01:07:56,798 --> 01:07:57,180
Rym: they're done.

965
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,249
Rym: I don't want to play with them again.

966
01:07:58,269 --> 01:07:58,551
Rym: That's it.

967
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,116
Scott: What if you do that?

968
01:07:59,156 --> 01:07:59,559
Scott: You're wrong.

969
01:08:00,662 --> 01:08:01,669
Rym: Well one I wouldn't do that.

970
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:02,434
Rym: Unless I had proof.

971
01:08:02,696 --> 01:08:12,936
Rym: Of course not Suspect somebody kind of awkward if I said but then again the way I play board games It's very obvious if someone is cheating and if I know someone is cheating.

972
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:28,332
Rym: based on that All I have to do is wait for the the point at which there is a reliable audit trail because most board games Have a pretty good audit trail to where you can count back turns and determine, you know He couldn't have moved more than X spaces and still have more than Y resources left.

973
01:08:28,694 --> 01:08:30,420
Rym: Hey, he has Z resources.

974
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:31,612
Rym: That's impossible.

975
01:08:31,894 --> 01:08:35,772
Rym: He cheated Mmm, he might have made a mistake and that's the point.

976
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,680
Rym: you call him on it and then you know you go from there.

977
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:45,803
Rym: But yeah I basically I will end a game immediately if someone has cheated and I will refuse to continue to play a game if someone cheated Mm-hmm.

978
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:49,520
Scott: Is there you know, is there any real like excuse for someone is cheating?

979
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:50,122
Rym: Never.

980
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:50,823
Scott: No?

981
01:08:51,024 --> 01:08:51,205
Scott: No.

982
01:08:51,846 --> 01:08:52,529
Scott: You don't think so?

983
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,252
Rym: I don't think so.

984
01:08:53,473 --> 01:08:55,800
Scott: There's no good reason to like go and break the rules.

985
01:08:56,682 --> 01:09:03,299
Rym: Well, suppose your daughter was kidnapped Okay, and you're playing and the guy says beat me in Puerto Rico and I won't murder her.

986
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:09,310
Scott: Well, cuz I mean, you know you talk about stuff, you know You look at like some of those mahjong shows and gambling and manga.

987
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:10,533
Rym: Well, see that's the situation.

988
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:16,599
Rym: There are games like that where there are real-world situations independent of games where

989
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:17,582
Scott: Cheating

990
01:09:18,024 --> 01:09:29,700
Rym: as in going against the rules of something the implied rules the written rules Whatever is in your personal best interest and that brings up the the same thing of enforcing game stuff in game in the real world.

991
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:30,203
Rym: You know what?

992
01:09:30,223 --> 01:09:31,733
Rym: The rules are physics.

993
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:36,551
Rym: Yep And if I do if you violate physics you are cheating.

994
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:39,198
Rym: that is the only way to cheat in the real world.

995
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:39,640
Rym: Really?

996
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:49,078
Rym: Mmm, so if I can get away with it It wasn't cheating and Society may impose based on the power they have over me some punishment for the fact.

997
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,919
Rym: some slight You know I've broken a rule that society agreed upon.

998
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:57,380
Scott: Society can punish me if that's just something that they're choosing to do also within the laws of physics.

999
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:58,125
Rym: That is just.

1000
01:09:58,145 --> 01:10:10,140
Rym: it's Hannibal Lecter situation where if someone Cannot be punished by society because society has no power over them Then they can get away with a lot and basically do whatever they want and they have transcended humanity.

1001
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,787
Rym: They're a transhuman and they probably need people.

1002
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:24,809
Rym: and I'm not advocating that people should do these sorts of things because I like all good People have an ethical and moral code but at the same time cheating is in the real world.

1003
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:26,313
Rym: is this really strange?

1004
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:39,759
Rym: long sliding subjective scale and cheating in what there's no such thing as absolute cheating because breaking the rules of a game is only Cheating if it can be enforced by the rules of the world.

1005
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:41,085
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's your.

1006
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:44,000
Scott: it's like, you know, we in the in the real world, right?

1007
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,955
Scott: It's like no matter what anyone thinks you can't you know Scott?

1008
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:49,280
Scott: look make something for nothing.

1009
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,264
Scott: It's the laws of physics.

1010
01:10:50,304 --> 01:10:55,124
Rym: in a way the speed limit on the road outside our house is 15 miles an hour according to that Sign.

1011
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:55,508
Scott: Yep.

1012
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:59,427
Rym: Have you ever Seen anyone drive 15 miles an hour.

1013
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:00,851
Scott: They did it a few times for lulls.

1014
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:03,540
Rym: I actually I do it every day because it's hilarious.

1015
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:06,234
Scott: Yeah, no, but you know the laws of physics.

1016
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:07,480
Scott: You just can't break them.

1017
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,960
Scott: You know, we can't do anything that breaks the laws of physics.

1018
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:13,780
Scott: But in a board game the rules are just on paper.

1019
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:24,480
Scott: They're not actually physically enforced unless you know, you have some perfectly coded video game that you know You didn't modify in any way in which case the rules are physically enforced.

1020
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:25,725
Rym: Now the real.

1021
01:11:25,925 --> 01:11:29,720
Rym: the other issue too is some game like I see some people discussing some games.

1022
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:41,876
Rym: they they'll rate a game not just based on skill or lock or theme or any of those things but based on the Ability of players to cheat without being caught and how enforceable the rules are in a game.

1023
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,885
Rym: because some games have very Unenforceable rules.

1024
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:53,420
Scott: that's true some games and it's like you look at something like say You know T&E I could just draw a tiles and always have two extra tiles in the crib.

1025
01:11:53,691 --> 01:12:00,218
Scott: Yep And nobody would really know unless they counted like the tiles in the bag or something Which is against the rules to count the tiles in the bag.

1026
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:03,873
Rym: Well, what you could do is have a in a tournament situation.

1027
01:12:03,913 --> 01:12:04,555
Rym: what I would do?

1028
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:05,820
Scott: have someone looking over everyone.

1029
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:12,949
Rym: You know every round at the beginning and end of a round players would have to flip all their tiles over Hide their score and turn over their screen.

1030
01:12:13,632 --> 01:12:15,620
Rym: That's not bad and show all of their face.

1031
01:12:15,701 --> 01:12:17,599
Scott: Oh, what if I just kept the tile up my sleeve?

1032
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:20,687
Rym: Well, yeah, but that everyone else wear short sleeves.

1033
01:12:21,329 --> 01:12:22,252
Scott: I kept it in my pants.

1034
01:12:22,753 --> 01:12:23,174
Rym: No pants.

1035
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:23,956
Scott: I have slayed a hand.

1036
01:12:24,398 --> 01:12:24,839
Rym: no hands.

1037
01:12:26,561 --> 01:12:31,479
Rym: You stand behind lose sight and you direct other people with notes that you press up to the glass.

1038
01:12:34,123 --> 01:12:40,000
Rym: But I Got my take on that is that if that's even a concern for you your friends are all douchebags.

1039
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,239
Rym: You shouldn't be playing games with them.

1040
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,559
Rym: Yeah, it is never in my life than a concern that any of my friends would ever cheat at a board game.

1041
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:52,043
Scott: I mean, it's actually sort of fun because always like if someone's doing well be like you cheater you're cheating Like.

1042
01:12:52,083 --> 01:13:11,702
Scott: we accuse people of cheating sort of sarcastically all the time, but no one ever actually intentionally cheats now Occasionally sometimes, you know, there's of course asterisk, but there are also situations in which you know, someone will maybe forget to do something or They'll do something incorrectly Accidentally, right like.

1043
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:25,020
Rym: maybe it's rare that it goes unnoticed just because bored German style board games tend to be so just number heavy And we're all Concentrating and analyzing so much that everyone's counting everything all the time like three people out of five.

1044
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,698
Rym: Well, pretty much immediately notice any discrepancy on the board at any given time.

1045
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:31,700
Rym: Yep Like hey, there's only two rocks on the rock thing.

1046
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,932
Rym: There should be three because the rock thing came out two turns ago.

1047
01:13:34,213 --> 01:13:35,500
Rym: Someone forgot to take a rock lava block.

1048
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:37,169
Scott: I think it's actually really cool.

1049
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:39,280
Scott: when you have some of the cool video games.

1050
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,360
Scott: I actually keep a log of the whole game like Wesnoth you can play back the whole game.

1051
01:13:43,601 --> 01:13:45,760
Scott: Yeah stuff like that is really cool.

1052
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,577
Scott: Because if there's any discrepancy, you know, you can see it somewhere in the game law.

1053
01:13:49,617 --> 01:13:54,275
Rym: or like Dracula It has that great mechanic of the whole game is enforced by the cards.

1054
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:55,380
Rym: You're putting down Dracula.

1055
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:56,860
Scott: Here's that son to talk about right?

1056
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,550
Scott: Let's talk about Dracula and Illuminati because those are interesting games.

1057
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,799
Scott: when it comes to cheating Dracula had the.

1058
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,607
Scott: What's the game actually called furry of Dracula?

1059
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:05,831
Rym: Fury of Dracula.

1060
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:08,980
Scott: actually, you know, the game has as a cheating rule.

1061
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:10,091
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

1062
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,905
Rym: games It's the same as Java.

1063
01:14:13,226 --> 01:14:13,486
Rym: you had.

1064
01:14:13,527 --> 01:14:14,750
Rym: you have the exception.

1065
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:18,820
Rym: the game will throw an exception if something outside the rules happens.

1066
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:23,656
Rym: If you don't handle that exception the game crashes right like Tigris in Euphrates.

1067
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:24,880
Scott: someone cheats, right?

1068
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:25,822
Rym: There's no way to recover.

1069
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:27,469
Scott: There's no way to like fix the game.

1070
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,695
Scott: The game's just screwed up.

1071
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:29,418
Scott: It's over right.

1072
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:39,280
Scott: but in Furry of Dracula if someone cheats the instruction book says, you know If Dracula cheats then this happens and it's very because Dracula is all alone.

1073
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,010
Scott: No one's allowed to look at what he's doing.

1074
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:49,320
Scott: so it's very possible for Dracula To do things in his hidden movement that are not legitimate.

1075
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:51,840
Scott: He can just move all the way across the board and try to cheat.

1076
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:55,289
Scott: Right, but he can also be caught.

1077
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:59,500
Scott: and if he's caught cheating then certain things happen that are very bad for drag.

1078
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,410
Scott: Well part of the reason.

1079
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,765
Scott: at the same time That's sort of right.

1080
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:07,200
Scott: having that rule on the one hand makes it so that the game is not gonna get screwed up.

1081
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:14,080
Scott: Right if Dracula accidentally or intentionally cheats right the game can continue and it'll be okay.

1082
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:20,419
Scott: But in a way that sort of encourages Dracula to try to cheat and get away with it.

1083
01:15:21,162 --> 01:15:23,474
Rym: Well, it luckily it's difficult for him to do so.

1084
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:24,681
Scott: it is very difficult to do So.

1085
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,127
Rym: I think that's just a situation of you.

1086
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,779
Rym: I think my Java exception analogy is probably the best one.

1087
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:30,468
Rym: Good games.

1088
01:15:30,589 --> 01:15:40,508
Rym: I've noticed have started to include Ways to handle anomalous situations such that you can continue to play the game Like we've seen other games where they have a rule.

1089
01:15:40,528 --> 01:15:43,360
Rym: for what if some player just up and quits near the end of the game?

1090
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,775
Rym: Well, this is that and then continue.

1091
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:48,731
Rym: Mm-hmm And that also prevents the game from crashing.

1092
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:50,680
Rym: and like Euchre we did the same thing.

1093
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,991
Rym: You know when I said our friends all cheated the.

1094
01:15:53,573 --> 01:16:02,207
Rym: in the way most people play Euchre There's the the renege and all the sorts of things that if you screw this up and you're caught The other team gets two points.

1095
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:08,314
Rym: you all this sort of stuff to just make the game continue to play Because in the Wild West rules, there's no rule for it.

1096
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:09,599
Rym: If someone cheats the cards, what do you do?

1097
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,079
Rym: You either say damn it you cheated or you shoot him in the face.

1098
01:16:13,762 --> 01:16:19,440
Scott: Yeah, no, but Illuminati actually has the cheating rule is try to cheat and don't get gone.

1099
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:23,879
Rym: I know Illuminati has two modes of play don't cheat try to cheat.

1100
01:16:24,942 --> 01:16:31,520
Rym: And the cheating game has rules for cheating and basically it specifies you are allowed to cheat in these areas.

1101
01:16:31,881 --> 01:16:34,431
Rym: You're not allowed to cheat in these areas.

1102
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,900
Rym: Here's what it happens if someone catches you cheating.

1103
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:39,940
Scott: Yeah, what it really does see they call it cheating.

1104
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:40,850
Scott: But what it really is?

1105
01:16:40,911 --> 01:16:47,200
Scott: it says, okay You are allowed to break these rules right and in a time as long as you aren't caught.

1106
01:16:47,281 --> 01:17:01,767
Scott: So really all it's doing is just adding Extra things to the game in terms of you know Making sleight of hand skills and distractive skills sort of count that otherwise don't count and it allows you to use You know different abilities in different ways.

1107
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,831
Scott: It's kind of.

1108
01:17:02,871 --> 01:17:09,120
Scott: it's kind of interesting, you know, it's like normally, you know You just you wouldn't do those things at all or if you did them your game would be fucked up.

1109
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:17,107
Scott: But Illuminati, you know, they explicitly tell you to try to do those things and as long as you don't get caught That's that's kind of interesting.

1110
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:20,240
Scott: it's like hey play Illuminati, but also play they don't get caught game.

1111
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:25,640
Rym: Yep, now along those lines you ever heard of the situation where you accidentally cheated at a game?

1112
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:26,942
Scott: Sometimes?

1113
01:17:26,963 --> 01:17:28,850
Scott: well, I never actually cheated.

1114
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:33,867
Rym: but where it looks you look down and you're like, alright I took one too many tiles.

1115
01:17:34,308 --> 01:17:35,532
Rym: I have seven tiles.

1116
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:36,194
Rym: It's teeny.

1117
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:37,116
Rym: Oh shit.

1118
01:17:37,457 --> 01:17:45,009
Scott: Yeah, or oops I made the change and properly have to give some back or you know, oops Sure that I have supposed to have that many.

1119
01:17:45,169 --> 01:17:51,968
Rym: the way I handle it is if it's something that can't affect another player and Can't like it's not something that can affect the game directly.

1120
01:17:51,988 --> 01:17:57,838
Rym: I will always go with the root of do whatever Resolution is the most harmful to me.

1121
01:17:58,562 --> 01:18:05,845
Rym: Yeah, like if I'm not like if I accidentally like if I'm not sure whether or not I took my victory points for the bath My dad in the previous turn.

1122
01:18:05,865 --> 01:18:07,552
Rym: I just don't take it's like.

1123
01:18:07,573 --> 01:18:10,043
Rym: well, I don't know if I took it or not So I can't take it.

1124
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:11,567
Rym: Yep a best case.

1125
01:18:12,009 --> 01:18:13,514
Rym: I'm I'm fine worst case.

1126
01:18:13,654 --> 01:18:14,136
Rym: I'm down.

1127
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:18,573
Scott: one point like oh Did I did I collect my money for the that income there?

1128
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,180
Scott: Oh, I forget if I collected it or not.

1129
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:24,720
Scott: Uh, I just won't collect it, you know, if you collect it well, then maybe you collect too much.

1130
01:18:24,842 --> 01:18:30,660
Scott: But if you don't collect it Well, then you know, maybe you don't maybe you didn't collect enough and maybe that would have helped you win.

1131
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:37,280
Scott: But at least this way, you know, you're sort of cheating to harm yourself in a way rather than cheating to help yourself.

1132
01:18:37,481 --> 01:18:43,080
Scott: Yep, I mean, you know, it's like I guess in some games, you know taking less money might be an advantage.

1133
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,111
Scott: Do you get this game has some sort of tax mechanic or something?

1134
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:53,086
Scott: But you know in most games, you know No one's gonna complain if you cheat to bring yourself down And farther away from winning.

1135
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:56,720
Rym: but the most even then in that situation anytime I've screwed up a rule.

1136
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,707
Rym: I think anyone who plays games should do this.

1137
01:18:58,727 --> 01:19:02,720
Rym: You just you kind of say hey everybody I screwed this up.

1138
01:19:03,226 --> 01:19:04,079
Rym: Here's what I did.

1139
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:05,785
Rym: How do we resolve this?

1140
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:06,910
Rym: to continue playing the game?

1141
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:09,240
Rym: Yeah, I accidentally have seven tiles.

1142
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:14,739
Rym: How about I flip them all over and someone randomly take one out right now and throw it away, you know, something like that?

1143
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:15,363
Rym: Yep,

1144
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:16,897
Scott: it's not a bad idea

1145
01:19:17,941 --> 01:19:21,858
Rym: Yeah, but I I also I want to get back to burning wheel because we talked earlier about well

1146
01:19:21,878 --> 01:19:28,105
Scott: burning wheel I also I was the one other I think I had to say about it was that it actually says in the rule book like Hey, don't worry.

1147
01:19:28,146 --> 01:19:31,257
Scott: If you screw up some rules sometimes, you know, there's so many rules here.

1148
01:19:31,297 --> 01:19:31,980
Scott: No one's perfect.

1149
01:19:32,322 --> 01:19:35,680
Scott: Just you know, if you screw something up, maybe you won't notice it.

1150
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,040
Scott: But if you do notice it don't try to fix it just make a note of it.

1151
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:48,590
Scott: So you don't screw it up next time and continue, you know, and that's sort of like hey, you know that the strict rules Lawyeriness is not the biggest deal in burning wheel.

1152
01:19:48,911 --> 01:19:55,739
Scott: having a good time is the biggest deal and you know That's appropriate as burning wheel as a role-playing storytelling game and not a winning losing game.

1153
01:19:56,523 --> 01:19:58,674
Scott: But in a winning losing game, you couldn't have that kind of rule.

1154
01:19:58,935 --> 01:19:59,799
Scott: It wouldn't work out at all.

1155
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,769
Rym: But I mean look at this is why burning wheel is so special.

1156
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:24,816
Rym: because in games a lot of role-playing style games There's the whole meta game where you know my character doesn't know something but I know it and DMS always have to deal with the problem of a player will have their character act in a certain way that they wouldn't have normally done because The person playing the character knows something they saw on the other person's character sheet that sort of thing.

1157
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:33,166
Rym: and The reason I love burning real so much is that the game is designed to encourage you to do that and that by doing That the game will be better.

1158
01:20:33,748 --> 01:20:40,860
Scott: Mmm that doing the meta stuff by very things I would like some be considered cheating actually make the game better.

1159
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:48,279
Scott: Yes, so doing everything you possibly can to get your way can only improve the game and cannot worsen it.

1160
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,469
Rym: Do we have anything else to say?

1161
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:51,233
Scott: I don't know.

1162
01:20:51,776 --> 01:20:52,560
Scott: We had a lot of stuff.

1163
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:53,965
Rym: Cheated games.

1164
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:58,019
Rym: gold farming isn't cheating because it doesn't hurt anyone but no one.

1165
01:20:58,785 --> 01:21:14,740
Scott: Yeah, cheating pretty much, you know Depending on your definition of cheating if you agree with me or Rym I think we both agree that you know cheating is you know, whether it's cheating or not It's only wrong if you're you know, breaking the rules to get an unfair advantage and you ruin the game for other people.

1166
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,441
Scott: That's that's the big deal.
