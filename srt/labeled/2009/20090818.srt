1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,407
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, August 18th.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:12,088
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,360
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight games of Tron.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:33,595
Rym: When I play Civ 4 I'd like to be the good guy.

6
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,199
Rym: I like to think I am a good leader.

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,785
Rym: I like to build libraries And universities and have all this culture and I generally try to like.

8
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:49,650
Scott: I played kind of this really nice Standard game that I always know and you know you always play and there's always one AI does the jerk.

9
00:00:51,111 --> 00:01:00,648
Rym: I'm looking at you, and you don't want to be the jerk right, but today You know I've been playing on the train And I decided for once to really just go all out because I just can't.

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,090
Scott: I tried.

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,937
Scott: I just can't be the jerk.

12
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:07,816
Scott: like every time I try to attack people and pester them It's like you know.

13
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,443
Scott: I noticed that the computer when they're a jerk.

14
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,890
Scott: They never actually give a real attack.

15
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,730
Scott: They just sort of pester.

16
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:16,887
Scott: I Try to do a real attack and I always expend all my resources attacking and I fall behind that I lose.

17
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,797
Rym: you haven't played much Civ 4 have you because when?

18
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:33,630
Rym: when the AI attacks especially if it's Tokugawa They tend to wait and wait and wait and then one round you see like 40 elephants sitting right on the edge of your borders, and then they'll ask you for like can you spare some optics?

19
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,835
Rym: And if you're like no, they're like okay war.

20
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:37,580
Rym: and if you're like yes, they're like okay war.

21
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:45,590
Rym: But on the train I was Zulu and I had these all these spearmen.

22
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,730
Rym: I'm trying to play my normal standard game, and I kind of almost roleplay when I place it for.

23
00:01:50,673 --> 00:02:01,109
Rym: But then I'm looking at all these Spearmen that I built and I noticed that the neighboring civilization Which is currently the number one civilization of Charlemagne has nothing but horse archers.

24
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:08,401
Rym: and Yeah, I destroyed his civilization And I'm rolling across the time being the jerk.

25
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,410
Scott: That's just taking the low-hanging fruit.

26
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:11,476
Rym: He was more.

27
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,870
Rym: He was far higher than me more powerful than me.

28
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:19,288
Rym: He just happened to have an army that consisted primarily of horses, and I happen to have almost nothing but spearmen.

29
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,801
Scott: no Well, then you had an army of horses and spearmen didn't you?

30
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:34,966
Scott: so then I invaded everyone else on the continent And I've basically been alternatingly declaring something if you can conquer someone else early in a game of Civ 4 especially if they have a bunch Of technologies you basically have this huge upper hand.

31
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,472
Scott: now for the rest of the game It's game over.

32
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:42,670
Rym: especially Civ 4 has all those cool options like having them capitulate to you or becoming a vassal state of yours.

33
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:44,505
Rym: Yeah, all sorts of cool stuff.

34
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,004
Rym: The moral is I got to stop playing so far on the train.

35
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:49,130
Rym: I'm not getting anything else done.

36
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:52,078
Scott: Yeah, so I knew it was gonna happen.

37
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,686
Scott: You know I've been riding this train for a bajillion years.

38
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,010
Scott: It's gonna happen one day.

39
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,869
Scott: It's gonna have some stomach trouble on the train.

40
00:02:59,231 --> 00:02:59,934
Scott: It was unpleasant.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,209
Rym: have you for the first time in your life pooped on a metro north train?

42
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,060
Scott: now I've pooped on the train a handful of times before.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:14,250
Rym: I'm talking about in the bathroom not in the vestibule But This is an unpleasant pooping on the train.

44
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:19,030
Rym: Is this gonna be one of those epic stories like Scott naked on the bathroom floor when he's sick?

45
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,150
Scott: No, it was more like I was walking towards the train.

46
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,444
Scott: I sat on the train as soon as I sat down.

47
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,470
Scott: I didn't feel so right.

48
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:32,940
Scott: I got up, and I had to pester the guy next to me which I was like sorry whatever I went to the bathroom, and I pooped.

49
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:35,448
Scott: and you know those train toilets.

50
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:45,930
Scott: luckily I got one that was pretty good and worked and no one else needed to use it during the whole train ride But you know they don't have a lot of water in them, so you can really see your poop pretty well.

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,619
Scott: I'm not gonna gross anyone out though.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,686
Rym: as we know from German toilets It's good to see your poop.

53
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:57,816
Rym: in fact You should look at your poop because it's a good indicator of your health And it's nasty.

54
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:01,650
Scott: poop looks a lot different when it's just sitting there than when it's falling into a big pool.

55
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,785
Rym: Part of it is there's something clean and sterile not really, but just viscerally.

56
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,334
Rym: when you see poop, and it's in like water It's like all right.

57
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,565
Rym: It is in a toilet where it should be.

58
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:21,430
Rym: all is right with the world But when you see human poop And it is not submerged in water that most of the time indicates a severe dysfunction in some manner.

59
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,988
Rym: Yeah, either someone is pooped where they should not have pooped.

60
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,162
Rym: So At least you did not lose.

61
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:29,989
Rym: don't shit your pants.

62
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,269
Scott: No, no, but I had to pester the guy next to me again when I had to poop a second time.

63
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,715
Scott: Oh, but one.

64
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:39,869
Scott: the interesting thing right is not the pooping right which is just what was it?

65
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,366
Rym: Dave Riley said the best thing in the world is pooping and the worst thing in the world is too much pooping right.

66
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,772
Scott: so it's that You know.

67
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:50,883
Scott: when I had to poop the first time the conductor was coming down to collect the tickets And I passed him on my way to the toilet.

68
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:51,849
Scott: It was in the rear car.

69
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,616
Scott: He didn't ask for my ticket.

70
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,630
Scott: when I walked past him all right, I pooped all right.

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,489
Scott: I came out of the pooping and went back to my seat.

72
00:04:58,712 --> 00:04:59,950
Scott: He never came and asked for my ticket.

73
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,497
Rym: How far were you along the way?

74
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,170
Rym: because I've noticed there's a point after which they don't seem to care anymore.

75
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,039
Scott: Well, it was just like a one-stop train.

76
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,084
Scott: It was beacon first stop.

77
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,450
Rym: Yeah, they only check once on that train.

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,418
Rym: It'd be trivial to get where I'd that train without paying as long as you're willing to Sit in that bathroom for a little while.

79
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,643
Scott: so I did, but it's like.

80
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:21,190
Scott: I walked right past him right He was going from the back of the train to the all right Scott conductor on a train.

81
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,870
Rym: Here's what he thought that guy has to poop.

82
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:34,273
Rym: Nothing in the world will put me in between him and pooping in the place He should be pooping because I'm a conductor and I've encountered after there should be after I poop the second time Right.

83
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:41,349
Scott: instead of going back to my seat and pestering the other guy again I just sat down on the floor outside the bathroom just in case you know.

84
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,695
Scott: But I made it to beacon.

85
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,770
Scott: sitting there also was really weird when I sat in my seat.

86
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,090
Scott: It was a window seat that saw like it was cool The air conditioning was working but that Sun hit my face to the window is just like murder.

87
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:59,341
Scott: so it was better to sit on the floor so the Sun couldn't get me and Then poop on one side on the other.

88
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,747
Rym: you had no way to win.

89
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,850
Scott: the conductor Right was right there when I was sitting on the floor didn't pester me.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,250
Rym: So again Scott you see a guy get up on the train where people normally don't get up and head to the bathroom twice.

91
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:15,061
Rym: Then he sits down outside the bathroom on the floor.

92
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,007
Rym: You did not want to disturb that man.

93
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,808
Rym: less poop appear also, I.

94
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,870
Scott: It seems like the people who'd run the parking at the train station.

95
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:30,250
Scott: They it seems like they're only coming to like write tickets like once like every few weeks.

96
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,255
Rym: Yeah, they call me for that.

97
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,662
Rym: I got a ticket today.

98
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:38,890
Scott: Yeah, really today Yeah, cuz I parked up on the street cuz I didn't get a spot.

99
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,609
Rym: I think they back right like they only go and check like a spot check.

100
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:50,446
Scott: Yeah, I think that I parked up on the street today And I did not get a ticket cuz I ran onto the train so fast without paying.

101
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,570
Rym: they just didn't care.

102
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,610
Scott: No, I think they're not checking up on the street.

103
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,324
Scott: We should just park up on the street and get.

104
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:56,029
Scott: we'll get away with it.

105
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,897
Rym: I'm not gonna do that.

106
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:57,341
Scott: why not?

107
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,374
Rym: cuz I like parking, you know Remember I get there early enough.

108
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,679
Rym: I can park like right.

109
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,600
Scott: next to the thing is the trick is most people try to park up On the street near the right-hand entrance.

110
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:08,952
Scott: I park up on the street on the left-hand Hill.

111
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:14,310
Scott: so basically I just walk up the steep hill and I'm at my car And I walk down the steep hill and I'm at the trains, you know.

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,945
Scott: And it's actually not really any farther than say parking in the faraway parking spots.

113
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,650
Scott: It's just uphill.

114
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,346
Scott: So that'll deter many a larger individual indeed, but you know as long as it's not raining.

115
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,430
Scott: It's totally awesome.

116
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,303
Rym: Thing is if I get that house, I'll be living so close to the train station.

117
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,610
Rym: I'll just walk or bike every day.

118
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,949
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing Really?

119
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,946
Scott: Well, I might permit expire because they didn't want to have to deal with it.

120
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,340
Scott: if I you know Cuz I'm gonna move hopefully relatively soon.

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,650
Scott: I'm gonna start turning up the heat on my Investigations even though I got a ticket But I don't want to bet to pay a bunch of money for parking in the meantime.

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,984
Rym: The ticket was so cheap that the fact that I have not paid for much was the ticket.

123
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,831
Rym: It's like 40 bucks 40.

124
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,313
Rym: Here's the thing.

125
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,430
Rym: I'm not paid for parking in over a year of parking.

126
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,606
Scott: Wait, so it was 40 for parking in a metered spot without.

127
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,299
Scott: yeah Whoa, cuz it was only 20.

128
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,890
Scott: I got 20 for parking in a permit spot without a permit.

129
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,779
Rym: Well, I don't know why it was 40, but it was there.

130
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:12,015
Rym: and the thing is I didn't pay the $3 or whatever For over a year.

131
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:13,264
Rym: so kind of add it up.

132
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:14,170
Rym: Yeah, I still win.

133
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,577
Scott: Yeah But now I'm gonna go to.

134
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:17,119
Scott: I'm gonna.

135
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:21,138
Scott: I'm gonna get parking up on the street and I'm not gonna pay until I get Another ticket up there.

136
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,481
Rym: too bad.

137
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,510
Rym: I can't do the RIT thing.

138
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:30,670
Rym: I know it wouldn't work of where I used to keep a bunch of parking tickets and whenever I parked illegally I would just put one on my car and then no one would bother to run me another one.

139
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,565
Rym: Yeah, because I already had the policy of one ticket per violation per day.

140
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:40,669
Rym: Mm-hmm That worked real well until one day I saw a guy standing there holding the ticket waiting for me to come back to my car.

141
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,668
Rym: He was like, what's all this?

142
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:44,837
Rym: And my response.

143
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,562
Scott: I don't know.

144
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:46,830
Rym: I left my car here for like a week.

145
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,193
Rym: You got any gaming news Gaming news.

146
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,341
Rym: I don't think people want to hear more about pooping and parking.

147
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,588
Scott: Yeah, there is one gaming news.

148
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,210
Scott: That was today.

149
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,233
Scott: That was gigantic.

150
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:07,029
Scott: I guess to some people is that the slim ps3 rumor is for real.

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,722
Rym: Let me tell you I was surprised at how slim it is.

152
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,830
Scott: Well, it's actually not that slim.

153
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,710
Scott: I think the pictures make it look a lot better.

154
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:20,590
Scott: When you look at it in pictures next to the actual three original ps3, it's not that slim.

155
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:25,786
Scott: It's like, you know, it's basically like original ps2 sized, you know, it's.

156
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,050
Scott: it's not like this is tiny.

157
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,341
Scott: It's just tiny compared to the gigantic monster.

158
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,689
Scott: That is you know, the original ps3.

159
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:37,685
Scott: It's like calling a camera tiny because you know next to Godzilla it's like oh, yeah sure.

160
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:38,528
Scott: Camera is tiny.

161
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,122
Rym: Yeah, sure Okay, fine compared to the original Xbox.

162
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,150
Rym: It is perhaps portable perhaps.

163
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:48,490
Scott: The thing is is actually, you know, it actually looks a lot more pleasant.

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,225
Scott: You know, it still doesn't have any freaking games and the price is I guess reasonable.

165
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,330
Scott: now, right at what?

166
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,057
Scott: $300 with 120 gigs that's not bad.

167
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,310
Scott: But so the system I guess doesn't suck anymore, but still has no games.

168
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,222
Scott: So, I guess it's a blu-ray player if you really want one.

169
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,850
Scott: but digital is the win and blu-ray is to dead.

170
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,956
Scott: So that's all I got to say.

171
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:24,726
Scott: I mean, you know if there were good games of the ps3 and I Had video games and I needed more video games because I have more video games than I know what to play Right, then I might consider one if I already had a 360, you

172
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,268
Rym: know, it's funny.

173
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:36,450
Rym: thinking back It's amazing how much people seem to be vested in this fight between Sony You know the HD DVD and the blu-ray when really it was kind of like the Crimean War there were no winners.

174
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,970
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean blu-ray is sort of the quote winner.

175
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,279
Scott: The thing is right blu-ray still isn't.

176
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,110
Scott: you know, there aren't enough players first of all, right?

177
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,461
Scott: they're not cheap enough even though they're getting cheaper and the discs are still too expensive for anyone to care.

178
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:52,169
Scott: and most people are happy with DVD.

179
00:10:52,189 --> 00:11:02,210
Scott: and I think I read somewhere that you know Even though blu-ray is quote one there are more HD DVD players out there in people's homes than blu-ray players.

180
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,196
Rym: Where'd you get that?

181
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:04,101
Rym: some guy on the internet?

182
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,430
Scott: There was some guy on the internet.

183
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:06,114
Scott: It was an.

184
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:06,899
Scott: it was like a little stuff.

185
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,630
Rym: Are you sure it was some guy on the internet?

186
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,698
Scott: I can show you the link.

187
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,667
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't?

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,571
Scott: Nothing.

189
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,378
Scott: Yeah, believe it if you want to.

190
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:25,570
Scott: but it said a thing on the internet said that there were more HD DVD players in people's houses and blu-ray players in people's houses, so There's this article and I'm not going to talk about the article.

191
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,008
Rym: The article is well-written and there's a lot of good discussion about it.

192
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:40,190
Rym: But on Tetenhammer the question that has been asked the the the point of all this is quote The balancing act the challenges of class balance in massively multiplayer online games.

193
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:47,810
Rym: so there's this huge article and People talking about the article on slashdot and other places.

194
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,395
Rym: It's like every.

195
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,005
Rym: there's this monkey in the room that no one's looking at the monkeys pooping on everything.

196
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,690
Rym: Yeah, he's destroyed the walls.

197
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:55,569
Rym: He's parked his car.

198
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,253
Rym: We shouldn't have.

199
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,550
Rym: but no one is talking about the the monkey or maybe the monkey shouldn't be doing that.

200
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:05,489
Rym: They're all debating like the the hat the monkeys where they can't think outside the box.

201
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:15,870
Rym: But this whole thing the whole discussion hinges on the age-old That the problem that has existed since the first mud the very first mud when they're in since freaking.

202
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,818
Scott: You know hero quest or D&D.

203
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,630
Rym: it's existed in the first game where there were classes.

204
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:25,124
Rym: some guy playing a fighter looked at some guy playing a wizard and said this is bullshit.

205
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:26,649
Rym: wizards are more powerful than fighters.

206
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:41,287
Rym: and There's been this kind of unwritten assumption in all gaming forever that in any massively multiplayer game or even any multiplayer game the classes all have to be either perfectly identical or perfectly balanced equal but different.

207
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:48,550
Rym: and Every piece of gaming literature just about that I encounter on a daily basis or anything anyone writes about or articles like this.

208
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:55,590
Rym: People always seem to just assume this truism guy it brings you back to our packs panel, but I'll get to that later.

209
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:56,793
Rym: I don't know.

210
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:59,641
Rym: Why doesn't anyone ask why classes have to be balanced?

211
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,910
Rym: Why can't you make a game where they're actually unbalanced?

212
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,330
Rym: I think it would make a better game.

213
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,715
Rym: I think make things more interesting.

214
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:17,968
Scott: the reason is because when you're playing a game of combat right say for example D&D fourth edition which is the prime example of this right and the only thing people are really doing is fighting and you get rewards for winning at fighting.

215
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:27,737
Scott: right if One person has like a hundred attacks that are all wicked powerful and awesome and the other person all they can do is like poke things of the stick Right what?

216
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:38,064
Scott: and the whole game is fights the whole time The person with the hundred attacks of awesome is gonna have all this fun doing all this awesome shit and the person who can poke Things with a stake is gonna sit there being bored with nothing to do.

217
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:46,330
Scott: and so When you have a game like that you need all but consider this the common incentive for winning these things.

218
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:58,518
Rym: So what the game gives you in reward for doing what it is that you were doing is usually XP Which makes you level up, but if everything's balanced and everyone levels up at the same rate based on the same stuff You're not really gaining anything.

219
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:04,561
Scott: You're just kind of unlocking content because it's not versus It's just grind your own self hamster in a wheel action.

220
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:04,861
Rym: the other.

221
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:13,961
Rym: the real trouble is that MMOs really if you look at it they don't reward that many behaviors in game and When they do they often do it in a very shallow manner.

222
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,010
Rym: and there are games that have tried to do other things.

223
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:24,354
Rym: I mean I knew someone who very unironically played a dancer in Star Wars galaxies and only cared about dancing But the game.

224
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,390
Rym: how much was there to reward people who are good at dancing?

225
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,466
Rym: Compared to how much was there to roar people who are good at killing shit mm-hmm.

226
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,806
Rym: and What this brings me to is one this article.

227
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:36,290
Rym: you can read it.

228
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:42,317
Rym: I think almost everyone gaming is missing the point and I think There's this almost greater problem of.

229
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:47,642
Rym: there are a lot of assumed arguments in gaming like the console wars No, the PlayStation is gonna win.

230
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:48,710
Rym: No the Xbox is gonna win.

231
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,654
Rym: No, the Wii is gonna win.

232
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,945
Rym: and no very few people make the point of.

233
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:59,461
Rym: maybe There's no such thing as winning or maybe we need to look at this from a different angle And I think that's that's what happens in any sort of realm.

234
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,588
Scott: right is when gaming was new right there was.

235
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,917
Scott: no there weren't even Genres.

236
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,250
Scott: just every game was a game.

237
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,603
Scott: You know like what genre is Donkey Kong?

238
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,790
Scott: I guess a platformer?

239
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:08,894
Scott: Maybe what?

240
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:22,263
Scott: now we have genre is like pac-man a pac-man I mean, but now people look at a game like a war game an RTS once and labels and You know like you know standard tropes.

241
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,917
Scott: They can't escape them They can't think outside of them.

242
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:30,310
Scott: once they have this you know framework to think within Yeah, you get all this can't think of anything else outside of it.

243
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,724
Rym: It's like all this conceptual baggage where you think well Yes, so it has to have this and this and this.

244
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:42,198
Scott: there's this idea I forget what the idea is called that actually like language limits What the ideas people can have like.

245
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,444
Scott: well are you know it's.

246
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:48,870
Scott: I'm not saying whether it's true or not But I'm saying there's an idea out there that I was about to say that there there are many arguments again.

247
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:49,690
Rym: Yeah, sort of thing.

248
00:15:49,690 --> 00:16:01,861
Scott: I'm just saying there's an idea out there that you know people can't think of ideas that they are unable to express with you know languages that they know and True or not that's basically you know.

249
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:10,107
Scott: sort of the same idea that we're seeing here Is that you know people had this sort of like this language of gaming right these ideas of gaming and people can't.

250
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:15,306
Scott: it's very difficult to be able to think of ideas in gaming that are outside of.

251
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,627
Scott: you know the nomenclatures

252
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:36,906
Rym: But anyway at the penny arcade expo in Seattle, which is coming up over the holiday weekend It just so happens that one of the panels we're doing there one of three is Losing should be fun which attacks one of the kind of assumed truisms of gaming that Losing socks and winnings awesome and that gave the goal of all games should be to win.

253
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,692
Scott: interestingly enough There's an.

254
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,037
Scott: I looked at the panel schedule.

255
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,080
Rym: Oh, yeah some.

256
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,666
Scott: they apparently write.

257
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:51,630
Scott: some other guy He's actually a game industry professional has a panel called winning sucks And I read the synopsis and it sounds like he's got the same idea as us.

258
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,290
Scott: And I wonder why they thought that they should give the same.

259
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,570
Scott: You know two people submit almost the same panel idea, and they schedule both of them.

260
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,381
Scott: I think that was a mistake.

261
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:12,424
Rym: I don't know but whatever I'll go to his panel, and it's hard to say because I kind of you know after packs much like we do with every other convention I kind of sidestep the standard process and just have contact.

262
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:18,885
Rym: so maybe the people I talked to Just gave us the panel, but then the normal process brought this other panel in through the normal channels.

263
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,410
Scott: who knows how it happened?

264
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,150
Scott: But I just think it's kind of weird and it'll be interesting.

265
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:26,983
Scott: And I'm sure the I'm you know the other guy's panel sounds pretty good actually.

266
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:28,470
Scott: so I'm gonna check it out.

267
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,803
Scott: You know to make sure and you know we'll handle it professionally.

268
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,505
Scott: It'll be all right.

269
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,770
Scott: It's not like it's a competition.

270
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,816
Scott: Oh, no, we had the same panel.

271
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:39,246
Scott: I guess we had to hate each other and be all versus bloody blood.

272
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,983
Scott: no obviously We agree with this dude from what I can tell.

273
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,189
Scott: so we should be all buddy, buddy.

274
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:52,917
Rym: But in the Raven Theatre on Friday 1130 beyond the Candyland Oh, man, that's us.

275
00:17:53,479 --> 00:18:06,050
Rym: and then in the not the Raven Theatre But the as I'm looking through the schedule over to the sun, maybe Unity Wolfman theater at 1030 on Saturday losing should be fun.

276
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:16,930
Rym: and then Sunday Sunday at 10 a.m.. Our headlining panel the panel that we're hopefully going to retire after next year beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

277
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,710
Scott: So basically we have like the first panel every morning.

278
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:28,287
Scott: Yeah, so it's pretty awesome for us because basically like we show up at the con early every day We do our panel, and then we the rest of the day do whatever we want.

279
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,475
Rym: the other thing I'm really excited about is this year We get a privilege.

280
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:36,120
Rym: I don't know if we got this last year and didn't take advantage of it But we actually get a privilege for being panelists.

281
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,332
Rym: we can go into the exhibit hall an hour and a half before the doors Open.

282
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,842
Rym: it's pretty and unknown worlds is gonna be in there.

283
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:43,590
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna go talk to the NS guys.

284
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,998
Rym: I'm going to talk to them until they get a restraining order.

285
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:51,247
Scott: Yeah, so how's that skull bitey bitey bitey bitey?

286
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,285
Scott: It was just bite them.

287
00:18:55,292 --> 00:19:10,785
Rym: No, I'm going to hold my upper body perfectly stationary and jump very slowly Mmm, and demand that babblers come back, but anyway things of the day.

288
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,930
Rym: What do you have for me Scott?

289
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,340
Scott: So I was looking around for thing of the day.

290
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,204
Rym: that sounds dangerous.

291
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,270
Rym: You kind of wound up to that.

292
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,995
Rym: I heard that whole intake of breath like I didn't find much.

293
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,060
Scott: that was gaming related.

294
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,170
Rym: I got like five things of the day.

295
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,843
Scott: Oh my delicious links are like text shit cuz I'm all Tekken lately.

296
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:34,230
Scott: There's that freestyle running guy who like College humor videos, which I didn't watch today, but anyway, I did find this.

297
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,970
Scott: It's actually two things and I'm sure I'm late to the party.

298
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,250
Scott: I'm sure that these are very old and I came to them and discovered them very late, but you know what I'm admitting it.

299
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,958
Scott: So that's fine.

300
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,927
Scott: other people, you know Some people come up, but it's only a problem if you find something old on the internet.

301
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:57,013
Scott: if you're like Hey, this thing's totally new and awesome, you know present it as if it's old and no one will tell you dude That's an antique right?

302
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:59,863
Scott: So anyway, what this is is two flash games.

303
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,007
Scott: I'm not sure if there's more.

304
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,050
Scott: they're on new grounds.

305
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:07,061
Scott: They're called Megaman verse Ghosts and goblins and Megaman verse Metroid.

306
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:18,280
Scott: and what it is is pretty much you play Metroid Except you're not Samus your Megaman or you play ghosts and goblins, but you're not Samus You're not what's-his-name Maxim is his name, right?

307
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,723
Rym: I don't know Max.

308
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:22,430
Rym: Well, I was never on Maximo.

309
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:27,990
Rym: I think maybe I was never all that up on the quote-unquote lore of ghouls and ghosts and ghosts.

310
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,475
Scott: I can't forget the dude's name.

311
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,458
Scott: But anyway, it's man.

312
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,682
Scott: What it's like that game.

313
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,188
Rym: Fuck that game.

314
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:36,429
Scott: That's true But your Megaman is said of that guy.

315
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:44,595
Scott: Basically these games like this is a really great concept really great graphical execution really great remixed music Execution.

316
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,930
Scott: they let you change the controls, which is nice.

317
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:54,230
Scott: They got some nice options, but the controls themselves are shitty and thus the games are relatively unplayable and frustrating.

318
00:20:54,692 --> 00:21:03,043
Scott: but it's still worth, you know a poke at both of them for a few minutes just to check it out and Hope that somebody else comes in and you know makes a fix.

319
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:09,020
Scott: I do want to also say I Don't know the name of this game, but apparently on Xbox Live Arcade.

320
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,802
Scott: There's a new game.

321
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:18,185
Scott: That is a Metroidvania type game And it apparently is the holy shit awesome times a billion from what I hear.

322
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:23,789
Scott: So if you have an Xbox Just go find whatever this game is that I don't know the name of?

323
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:25,899
Scott: That was so helpful, wasn't it?

324
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,045
Rym: That was great.

325
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:27,427
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,070
Rym: All right.

327
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,570
Rym: So for hopefully not all of you read Kotaku, but I have to link this because it's just too cool.

328
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:38,922
Rym: this is a collection of Artistic renderings of link in many different styles.

329
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,890
Rym: There are many many pictures here.

330
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,630
Rym: They're all fairly badass.

331
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:50,436
Rym: But I really really have to point out and stress to you the one that is basically link as Thor He's smoking.

332
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:53,670
Rym: He's got a giant sword and more muscles than Wolverine.

333
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,197
Scott: Wolverine doesn't have any muscles.

334
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,245
Scott: Yeah, you know who has muscles.

335
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:58,988
Scott: strong guy.

336
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:06,590
Rym: He's got a beard too, he's very just kind of Scandinavian and badass.

337
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:07,833
Scott: Watch out.

338
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:11,610
Rym: so we we couldn't come up with the show because we could come up with a show.

339
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,809
Rym: I came up with it just now we did but prior we couldn't come up with one because I didn't really have a chance to Play Blood Bowl yet, and I'm not really playing any new games.

340
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,237
Scott: I heard of a video game drought right now.

341
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,627
Rym: All my hopes are pinned on Starfy and NS2.

342
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,790
Scott: I downloaded Starfy.

343
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:27,639
Scott: It's just a sort of a platforming game.

344
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,030
Rym: It's like sort of a platforming game.

345
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,318
Scott: Oh, well, you might like Starfy.

346
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,150
Scott: But anyway, I only played it for like 10 minutes.

347
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:38,329
Scott: Anyway, you know after PAX which is in like, you know, we'll only have to do one more show before PAX.

348
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:42,806
Scott: So the thing is after PAX there's gonna be a glut of gaming.

349
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:43,910
Scott: I can almost guarantee it.

350
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,462
Scott: It's like every gaming company is holding back for PAX.

351
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:47,166
Scott: I can just tell.

352
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:57,763
Scott: but anyway There is if you don't know there's a. there's a new Tron movie coming out and Tron is like one of the most important geek Things there is in gaming and movies and animation.

353
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:59,450
Scott: It's total crossover in all areas.

354
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,464
Scott: But I watched the trailer and it was totally awesome.

355
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:04,650
Scott: at least the trailer was awesome.

356
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,917
Scott: Who knows if it's actually gonna be awesome, but you know, whatever.

357
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,710
Scott: but yeah Tron is something I like a whole lot.

358
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,394
Scott: You know, I mean like.

359
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:18,510
Scott: I think about video games and it's like you play a lot of video games But you wouldn't actually want to really play a lot of video games, right?

360
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,221
Scott: It's like would you really want to be in the world of Counter-Strike?

361
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:22,566
Scott: No, not really.

362
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:23,350
Scott: That would just suck.

363
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,961
Scott: Do you really want to be in the world of Donkey Kong?

364
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,870
Scott: No, that sucks big time, right?

365
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:28,713
Rym: I don't know.

366
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:35,759
Scott: Hyrule would be too bad to live in not too bad depending on who you were and what was going on at The time but you know what Tron like.

367
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,790
Scott: all I want is fucking real VR Tron.

368
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:44,350
Scott: I would never stop playing that game in a million years just riding bikes and throwing discs.

369
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:45,836
Rym: It's not much better than that.

370
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:51,970
Scott: So the thing is there in honor of this new movie that's coming out Which by the way, we'll have a Daft Punk soundtrack.

371
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:57,583
Rym: You know, what's really funny I Didn't know this and original Daft Punk soundtrack.

372
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:05,417
Rym: Scott comes home and he's like You're never gonna guess who's making the soundtrack for the neutron movie and I'm like, uh, I don't know Daft Punk You totally knew.

373
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,245
Scott: I just saw the tweet or something.

374
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,210
Rym: Basically, you know what I thought.

375
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,201
Rym: I thought to myself who would it be awesome if it were that?

376
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,750
Rym: it's definitely not and I was like Daft Punk.

377
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:15,641
Scott: but anyway the.

378
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,936
Scott: In honor of this new movie We will talk about all the.

379
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:24,381
Scott: there are many video games that are Tron that involve Throwing discs or riding bikes.

380
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:25,950
Scott: let it and many of them are good.

381
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,241
Rym: There's gonna be really through at least in terms of the bus.

382
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:29,844
Rym: start with bikes.

383
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:31,872
Scott: Yeah bikes Definitely.

384
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:38,050
Rym: there are two like completely opposite philosophies about this sort of game the top-down view and the first-person view.

385
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,055
Rym: And I'm gonna say right now.

386
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,749
Rym: I think they're equally awesome and that we should have both.

387
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:47,129
Scott: Yes, in fact, you know, why not have a game where you can just push a button and change the view?

388
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:48,655
Scott: I think GL Tron can do.

389
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:49,197
Rym: here's the thing.

390
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:54,098
Rym: if I can't have the choice and I want to win top-down always There's no reason to ever be first person.

391
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,292
Scott: Oh, yeah first person just makes it harder, but you know It's harder and more thrilling it does.

392
00:24:58,352 --> 00:25:02,909
Scott: it definitely makes a lot more thrilling but it's cool if everyone's playing first person because then it's like it's all.

393
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:13,770
Scott: you're getting closer to the real Tron that I'm looking for and actually didn't the the Arcade guy the retro arcade guy say he had like some crazy diss of Tron machine?

394
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,370
Rym: He did but I remember him saying that it was really difficult to move and dangerous to move and incredibly rare.

395
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,630
Scott: Yeah, the thing is I've seen screenshots of the diss of Tron arcade game.

396
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,510
Scott: I don't think I've ever actually played it like the original diss of Tron.

397
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,207
Scott: But anyway, we'll talk that's that's a disc game and we haven't played it so much.

398
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:35,590
Scott: So, I'm sorry It's probably one of the most important Tron games that we're not gonna talk about.

399
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:43,623
Rym: I mean honestly the one I played the most in my life was snafu for the Intellivision Yeah, which is basically Tron but it was four player Tron and it was in.

400
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:47,899
Scott: it had like a million different modes And there's also Tron for the Atari which is basically this.

401
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,847
Rym: to this day the music just like will pop into my head randomly especially whenever I see Tron related things.

402
00:25:52,867 --> 00:26:03,212
Rym: just The game was cool because not only could it be like many many player and I had these AI that would kind of play With you.

403
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:09,921
Rym: if the game turned out to be just for like computers left It would go in like super fast mode and just they would.

404
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,970
Rym: you would see which one won and it was really cool.

405
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:23,396
Scott: Yeah I spent at least a thousand hours of my life playing that with my little brother and my grandma And I said the thing about the the the bike games right is that it's basically everyone is basically a line that you draw.

406
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:32,670
Scott: you're drawing a line and everyone draws their line at the same speed and you basically If your line bumps into something a wall or another person you lose.

407
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,152
Rym: They're not.

408
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,398
Rym: there are not always walls.

409
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,242
Rym: Sometimes it wraps.

410
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:36,468
Scott: Sometimes it wraps.

411
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:36,810
Scott: It's true.

412
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:45,289
Scott: but if you if you bump into someone's bike or someone's line or you know a wall that doesn't wrap you're dead and it's whoever's alive at the end is the winner.

413
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,419
Rym: and It's funny because it's like this mix of strategy.

414
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,770
Rym: Yeah, it's not like who goes faster, right?

415
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,141
Scott: It's all about positioning and reflexes and well, well, well, it's technically.

416
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:59,930
Scott: it is a perfect information complete information game technically But it has speed to it, right?

417
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,074
Scott: It's like the thing is the same way.

418
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,199
Scott: the Tetris has speed.

419
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:04,590
Rym: the game is still discreet because it's on a computer.

420
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,830
Rym: There are units of movement.

421
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:14,956
Rym: So if you have just like Tetris But if you have the speed down it is literally nothing more than a game of plotting out the perfect strategy and it is Mathematically a solvable game.

422
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:18,190
Scott: Yeah, some of them you can move diagonal and some of them you can't though, right?

423
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,838
Rym: You had the best in.

424
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:20,844
Rym: not one was the Atari one.

425
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:25,625
Scott: when you can move diagonal Yeah cross over other people's like paths diagonally.

426
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:29,282
Scott: as long as you're in the right spot You can turn your path on and off.

427
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:34,630
Scott: Yeah, you could also like Drive into someone else's bike, you know, but not into the line.

428
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:42,240
Scott: So if you hit the if you crash into them directly and then turn away that you can actually avoid them and snap through to the other side.

429
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:53,537
Scott: and that's really good because it sort of avoids like the Pointless endgame of oh you've cut off, you know 51% of the board on your side and I've got 49% of the board on my side.

430
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:56,410
Scott: if we both play perfectly and don't slip up I lose thing.

431
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,674
Scott: I'll just kill myself.

432
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,099
Rym: Scott never played perfectly.

433
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,363
Scott: So I play perfectly.

434
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,590
Rym: we talking about should we whip out the Atari again?

435
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,497
Rym: Maybe film it.

436
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:04,064
Rym: We'll have a.

437
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:09,847
Scott: Maybe we should play some GL Tron - which is far more exciting and modern it is.

438
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:10,970
Rym: It's also a lot more difficult.

439
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,915
Scott: Yeah, GL Tron if you don't know is basically a 3d Tron that is open source pretty old Like it's it's.

440
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:18,510
Scott: it's been around for a long time.

441
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:18,871
Scott: It's all.

442
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:20,056
Scott: it's a Linux game, but it's all.

443
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:23,129
Scott: I think you can run it on pretty much fucking any computer that has open GL.

444
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,213
Scott: Alright.

445
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,498
Scott: and basically it's just Tron 3d.

446
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,884
Scott: That's it.

447
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:28,330
Scott: That's all there is to it.

448
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,799
Scott: It's just modern and fast and good-looking.

449
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,950
Scott: and you know, you did it looks like actual Tron.

450
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,048
Scott: In fact, it looks better than the first Tron movie a lot better.

451
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:43,877
Scott: But you know, it's out there and I think if you want to play a Tron bike game You just go get GL Tron.

452
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:46,870
Scott: Maybe I'll put a link to the to the website in the in the show thingy.

453
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:54,274
Rym: But basically, I don't know there's something about these sort of kind of very simple very direct competition games That to this day.

454
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,181
Rym: I always fall back on them.

455
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:56,964
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,390
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what it is.

457
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:58,811
Scott: It's like.

458
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:07,476
Scott: it's like just you know, there's a lot of competitive games out there the sort of complex and fiddly part Straight on mono a mono.

459
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:12,710
Scott: They're so simple draw a line versus the other guy drawn a line like outlaw shoot the other dude.

460
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,150
Rym: They're so simple play some fucking out and they're so, you know that minute to learn a lifetime to master situation.

461
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:34,783
Rym: but I think the simplicity of the rules and the directness of the competition creates this sort of Competitive intimacy to where you and the opponent, you know When you play a game of say Puerto Rico or Tigers and Euphrates against three equal Amazingly skilled opponents and it's a completely different game from playing against noobs.

462
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:40,824
Rym: in a game like this You you know that the other player has complete and total awareness of the game.

463
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:42,330
Rym: You cannot trick them.

464
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:44,210
Rym: Yeah, you know, you cannot trick them.

465
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,932
Rym: It is so.

466
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:50,190
Rym: it's almost like you are both the same person at the same time in the competition.

467
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:56,010
Rym: It's this really weird transference that I've only ever experienced in very simple very direct competition games

468
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:03,830
Scott: I think and I think that is part of the reason why I want to play like Tron in real life so badly, of course without the chance of dying, but you know, yeah

469
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:07,141
Rym: You know what happens when you fall down because

470
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:13,434
Scott: you combine cuz you know Tron even you know Whether you playing this game the game, you know It's like some games.

471
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:17,290
Scott: when you make them 3d or fancier they change fundamentally like say Mario.

472
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:23,390
Scott: Not that 3d Mario is bad, but it's fundamentally different when it's Mario 64 versus Mario 3, right?

473
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:33,938
Scott: But Tron whether it's like VR and you're actually riding bikes with light trails behind them or whether it's Atari with big Pixelated blocks just moving around a grid.

474
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,584
Scott: That's incredibly low resolution.

475
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:37,590
Scott: It's the same exact game.

476
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:48,834
Scott: The only thing is that the 3d VR one adds sort of like the roller coaster thrill of riding a bike at high speeds Whereas the Atari one does not have such a roller coaster, you know Thrill to it.

477
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:53,830
Scott: But otherwise, it is really the exact same thing in terms of the game and the competition.

478
00:30:54,372 --> 00:31:02,986
Scott: It's just so pure that it cannot be spoiled by enhancing it Unless you made it a different game in which case it's no longer pure now.

479
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,939
Rym: disc wise though I got to say my favorite Tron II.

480
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:13,690
Rym: this game even though it's really it captures I guess the spirit and the feel of Tron discs, but yet is nothing like Tron discs at all.

481
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,750
Rym: Yeah is ricochet which was like this mod that came with half-life in like back in 2000.

482
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,797
Scott: I don't know if you could.

483
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,770
Scott: I don't it might cost money now or if it's free.

484
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,433
Scott: I have no idea.

485
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:27,130
Rym: I don't think it's free unless you already have it, but and no one plays it.

486
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,870
Rym: I think we have to go check on steam unlike every other game that we want to play that You know that old games that are difficult to get together.

487
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,355
Rym: We got to set up VPNs or anything.

488
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,145
Rym: If you guys listeners all get ricochet.

489
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,410
Rym: We will play with you.

490
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:39,855
Scott: Ricochet is a game.

491
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:43,290
Scott: That's actually easy for everyone to get together and play ricochet.

492
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:45,559
Scott: Basically, it's a half-life 1 mod.

493
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,530
Scott: It was free for us at least.

494
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:55,374
Scott: I don't know if it's free for anyone else nine years ago nine years ago, and basically the way this game worked is an FPS and You.

495
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,430
Scott: there are different kinds of maps, right?

496
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,741
Scott: There's the dual maps and there's also the free-for-all.

497
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:02,949
Scott: everyone go all the time maps, right?

498
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:14,450
Scott: And you basically this is platforms and every platform is a big disc and Each platform has triangles next to it and you step on a triangle and it bounces you through the air to the next.

499
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:19,770
Scott: You know another platform so you basically bounce between these platforms by stepping on these triangles.

500
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:37,399
Scott: You can't jump all you can do is move and Throw discs and you have three discs that you can throw and once you've thrown the three discs you need to wait for them to regenerate before you can throw them again and The discs bounce off some of these walls like, you know Depending if there's a wall there for you to throw a disc at there's some.

501
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,852
Scott: Sometimes the discs might teleport if you throw them into a teleporter.

502
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:45,020
Scott: so you can throw a disc like in one direction But it ends up coming at the guy from another direction.

503
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,520
Scott: That's like power-ups and it is power-ups like freeze discs and triple discs and all that stuff.

504
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:52,620
Rym: He was just again so simple and so direct.

505
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,293
Rym: I mean we used to at RIT and even when we lived here we would play this game for like Six hours without stopping in.

506
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:03,040
Rym: like, you know There'd be ten people on the server and you just all took turns doing duels and watching the duels.

507
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,780
Scott: It was just some of the servers even set up to where I give this ten people.

508
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:11,460
Scott: Five duels happen at once and then it keeps mixing the people up based on who won a new lost.

509
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,636
Rym: This game is just so amazing and it doesn't really need to be updated at all.

510
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:17,920
Scott: No, it doesn't need any changes.

511
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:18,523
Scott: It's already.

512
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:19,146
Scott: it's perfect.

513
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,160
Rym: You could make the graphics better, but the gameplay was absolutely perfect.

514
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,919
Rym: It was a little bit tiny bit not necessarily buggy but fiddly.

515
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:31,719
Rym: Yeah in that, you know There'd be often be the situation where if two players jump and run into each other.

516
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,360
Rym: There was a fine art to making sure that they died slightly before you.

517
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:40,520
Scott: Yeah Cuz you could die by either getting a. you could die by getting hit by a chainsaw disc, right?

518
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,779
Scott: And basically if you didn't use any of your discs, you still had all three of them.

519
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:50,200
Scott: You could push secondary attack to throw a chainsaw disc and if that hits someone they were their head just popped off and they died.

520
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:54,060
Rym: Or you could die by being a dumbass and either falling or getting knocked off, right?

521
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,951
Scott: So you could fall off the map just by jumping improperly by stepping on a triangle and then like Pushing some arrows in the air in a way that made you fall off.

522
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,549
Scott: or if you got hit with a regular disc You didn't actually die.

523
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,779
Scott: You just got pushed a little bit.

524
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:12,178
Scott: so if you got you someone can throw their regular discs at you and push you off the edge which would kill you.

525
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,219
Scott: and of Course if you jump up and you bump into someone in the air, you're both gonna probably die.

526
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,469
Scott: But whoever dies first is a loser.

527
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:21,560
Scott: So there's always that situation.

528
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,187
Rym: It's just you know, what it is.

529
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:27,402
Rym: a is an elegant game from a more civilized age Absolutely.

530
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:30,681
Scott: I've always loved how they were like advanced players to do stuff like.

531
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:38,451
Scott: you would hit a triangle to jump in the air and usually you don't want to touch any arrows when you're jumping because That'll just knock out like loop around.

532
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:48,858
Scott: Yeah back on the same platform It's like, you know If you just don't touch any arrows at all after you step on a triangle you will land perfectly on the destination platform Assuming nothing else bad happens to you.

533
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,056
Scott: But if you do push some arrows properly you can like land on a platform that you're not supposed to land on.

534
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:58,600
Scott: like, you know Normally this arrow points to that platform over there.

535
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,800
Scott: But if I you know push left when I step on this I'll actually land on that platform over there.

536
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:10,300
Scott: And that's how you get advanced play and just totally own noobs By jumping and landing behind them when they don't think it's possible.

537
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,725
Rym: Plus there was this chainsaw in the back being like fencing where someone could use the chainsaw Which is the instant kill if it hits you.

538
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:21,044
Rym: but you could block discs that were shot at you with your own discs Yeah, and you could.

539
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,660
Rym: you could do like the one two where you block and you also shoot and then it was just so great.

540
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,405
Rym: Oh my god.

541
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,371
Rym: I want to play it right now.

542
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:27,995
Scott: Yeah, we should.

543
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:28,800
Scott: we should play it later.

544
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:34,200
Scott: But there's also the kinds of situations like at the beginning of every match if it was a duel, right?

545
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,239
Scott: It's like you get a little bit of time to walk around before the duel starts.

546
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:42,000
Scott: Of course, you can lose the duel before it starts by falling off which you just suck, right?

547
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:47,360
Scott: But you can also sort of posture, you know, it doesn't let you throw discs for like three seconds.

548
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,720
Scott: It counts like three two one go and then you can start throwing discs.

549
00:35:51,181 --> 00:36:03,616
Scott: so what'll happen is either a the players will sort of stay far away from each other and you know sort of go in or They'll get right up on the same platform as each other and sort of go And then maybe start the match off trying to do a chainsaw

550
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,119
Rym: right away.

551
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:05,704
Rym: that's another thing.

552
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:13,509
Rym: that the whole a lot of these old games like NS and this game have the ready room or the like Pre-match stuff for players.

553
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:24,480
Rym: that this whole psychological thing when when you start a match of ricochet Yeah, especially back then when there really wasn't voice chat Yeah, like you just kind of you'd see these two avatars kind of chest bumping and jostling for position.

554
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:34,457
Scott: In the the all the every man for himself mode Basically every time you die You just immediately respawn and it's a gigantic map that's got like multiple levels of altitude.

555
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:38,631
Rym: speaking of altitude I should point out aiming is only in one plane.

556
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:41,240
Scott: Oh, yeah, the game is effectively two-dimensional, right?

557
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,486
Scott: Even though it's a 3d FPS.

558
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,852
Scott: You can't aim up or down.

559
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:45,057
Scott: You can only aim straight for you.

560
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,640
Rym: Look up or down.

561
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:48,189
Scott: Yeah, you can't duck or jump.

562
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:53,120
Scott: You can only jump by stepping on the triangles But if you shoot it shoots out in a plane.

563
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,820
Rym: So if you shoot in the air and someone else happens to be in the air at the same time you can hit them.

564
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:57,473
Scott: That's right.

565
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:01,050
Rym: So play ricochet good God.

566
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,040
Rym: Yeah, there's like no one playing this game anymore.

567
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Scott: No, but in the in the every man for himself mode when you die you immediately respawn and there's multiple levels of altitude.

568
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:25,735
Scott: So it's like this Platforms in level one two and three depending on the map and it's just a whole bunch of people all at once trying to kill Each other as many times as possible, but it's totally awesome because unlike the dual mode right where you're worrying about one person There's these discs that is coming at you from all freaking directions and like.

569
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:27,060
Scott: there's all about the timing.

570
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,500
Scott: This is in both modes the timing of the power-up.

571
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:34,100
Scott: It's like, you know, the power-up will always appear like after this so many seconds.

572
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:37,932
Scott: It's like you'll be like, okay jump jump jump jump.

573
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,300
Scott: the power-up should appear now jump grab the power-up.

574
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,791
Rym: You know that's something a lot of old deathmatch style FPS has had would they?

575
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:53,763
Rym: there'd be the quad damage that would appear at a semi-regular or a regular interval and everyone knew where it was and all the advanced players knew exactly what it was gonna appear because they Were kind

576
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:57,460
Scott: they would you know, they wouldn't stand around and camp it like a new wood, right?

577
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,600
Scott: They they would time their mat their way.

578
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:10,779
Scott: They're walking around the map such that they will appear in that room at the time when the thing appears and just grab it Immediately and then be out of the room or they'll pointedly be on the opposite side of the map.

579
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:13,641
Scott: Yep, if they don't think that they can get to it They'll.

580
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:23,240
Rym: they'll be far away from where there were all these ways of Causing this kind of very specific ebb and flow of gameplay that I think a lot of modern games have lost in their rush for complexity.

581
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:33,214
Scott: Hmm one thing that's really cool about ricochet is that you know, you get these different power-ups the ice Disc which would freeze the other player allowing you to easily shatter him with a triple disc.

582
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:46,149
Scott: the the triple disc Which allowed which allowed you to throw three discs at once and sort of you know The joke that only we get There was what were the other power-ups?

583
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,380
Scott: Oh, there were the fastest that you could throw really fast.

584
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,536
Scott: The whole bunch of them power up stacked.

585
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:57,218
Rym: So if you You shot three fast discs, yeah, that was just something so simple.

586
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:57,560
Scott: like that.

587
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,943
Scott: It's like you could get triple speed ice discs and just be like new new new new new new new new and throw like a million Discs everything.

588
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:08,033
Scott: if you manage to collect three power-ups, it often didn't matter.

589
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:12,469
Rym: the power-ups were neat and powerful But they weren't necessarily game winners.

590
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,332
Scott: Yeah, I know right?

591
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,400
Scott: It's like, you know, oh no the other guy got the power-up.

592
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,971
Scott: It's gonna be like 30 seconds before another power-up appears.

593
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,980
Scott: He throws like a whole bunch of ice discs at you.

594
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:22,520
Scott: They're just normal discs that happen to freeze if they hit you.

595
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,729
Scott: So just don't get hit.

596
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,072
Rym: and if you're getting hit anyway Don't get hit and don't fall off right.

597
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,440
Scott: the guy might have the triple discs.

598
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,200
Scott: So there's nine discs bouncing around looking for you, but he could just as easily hit himself with those if he's not careful.

599
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:40,859
Scott: Yeah, because one of them might be aimed at you, but the other two might be bouncing off the wall sitting him in the ass.

600
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,798
Scott: So it was always kind of fun like that.

601
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:55,411
Scott: And plus when people get the fast discs that let you shoot a whole bunch of just real quickly they'll tend to just go nuts with them and not be too careful with them and Often hurt themselves because you know your own discs can hit you.

602
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:57,117
Scott: do you remember it's ricochet?

603
00:39:57,137 --> 00:39:58,140
Scott: these discs are bouncing.

604
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:58,943
Scott: No, they did not.

605
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,187
Rym: they didn't knock you back though.

606
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,194
Scott: No, but they you can reclaim them.

607
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:02,676
Rym: Basically.

608
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:08,577
Scott: No you did you could But you could also hit yourself with a chainsaw, which is not, you know, it didn't kill you.

609
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:09,078
Scott: It didn't.

610
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:21,019
Rym: did Just be a lot of play like I throw just behind me as I'm jumping forward knowing that it'll bounce and land on the platform I'm going toward because I expect him to jump to that platform away from with the chainsaw.

611
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,812
Rym: But then the disc I shot behind me hits him before I get there.

612
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:24,716
Rym: Yeah.

613
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:28,715
Rym: Oh my god You also got more points if you killed someone with more ricochets.

614
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:29,820
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's right.

615
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,840
Scott: Every time you kill someone it tells you how you killed them.

616
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,180
Scott: So it's like you killed him with a chainsaw blade that ricocheted twice big points.

617
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:46,520
Scott: You know you killed him with a direct hit with a normal disc, you know You were standing right on the same platform and you just threw a disc directly at him and hit him straight on one point.

618
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,954
Scott: Big deal, you know, you killed the other guy cuz he fell off.

619
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:56,556
Scott: no big deal at all Really, you know your dis bounced like five times and then hit the guy after going through a teleporter.

620
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:57,900
Scott: a billion points.

621
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,035
Scott: The thing is those things usually have by accident.

622
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:10,340
Scott: Yeah, I Mean you can usually get one or two ricochets or maybe a teleport kill on purpose But not a multiple ricochet and teleport kill is usually luck.

623
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,433
Rym: So do we have any other disc games to talk about?

624
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,480
Scott: I wish I had played disc of Tron more.

625
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,790
Scott: I mean, I've seen it and it's basically an old arcade game where you know this.

626
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:20,773
Scott: it's really.

627
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,438
Scott: it's sort of 2d ish 3d ish.

628
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,700
Scott: You know you stand on a disc you can sort of walk around it and throw discs to the other side But it's I don't really know how it plays.

629
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,000
Scott: I'd have to get like maim and try to play disc of Tron just to see how it goes.

630
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:34,483
Scott: I don't know.

631
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:36,153
Scott: were there any other Tron games?

632
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:39,620
Scott: Yeah, they're a whole bunch But yeah, I haven't played enough of them pretty much.

633
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:54,020
Scott: All you really need to know is that the game of riding light cycles Which basically is the game of drawing a line and try and trying to get the other guy to bump into your line is a Great game and the game of just throwing shit the other guy trying to hit him is a great game.

634
00:41:54,941 --> 00:42:00,580
Scott: And those are just these two really pure and simple games that were based off a movie about video games.

635
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:01,658
Scott: Think about that, right?

636
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:10,040
Scott: I mean It wasn't like someone invented these games and then someone made a movie about them like say Mario Brothers the movie Right or doom the movie or Halo the movie.

637
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:10,582
Scott: This is.

638
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:18,145
Scott: there was a movie about video games in general and they came up with these two games for the movie and they happen To be amazing games.

639
00:42:18,507 --> 00:42:19,430
Scott: When does that happen?

640
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,594
Scott: Only once ever.

641
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,060
Scott: That's it right there Tron.

642
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:24,664
Scott: so There you have it.

643
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:38,943
Scott: play Tron games so that you'll actually know what the hell's going on when you watch this new movie That's coming out And if you haven't seen the original movie Frickin see it before you see the new movie because I from the trailer I can already tell The new movie is only gonna make a lot of sense If you've seen the original.

644
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:44,056
Scott: you're like not gonna know who people are and such and such and I like Tron.

Scott: Oh And Tron guy we saw him at Panko Con 2.0.
