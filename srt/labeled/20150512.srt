00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,423
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

16
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,791
Rym: All I all I'll say now is that and also movies.

17
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:14,400
Rym: if you have a stereo probably less accurate.

18
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:25,747
Rym: Yeah if you have a stereotype of Hong Kong based primarily on like Asian cinema if you go to Hong Kong, you will know your way around and You'll feel like you're just in those movies.

19
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,854
Rym: Hong Kong is so close to every stereotype I had about it that it was kind of shocking.

20
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,450
Rym: I Fucking love Hong Kong.

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,014
Rym: Hmm.

22
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,422
Scott: So yeah Marry it.

23
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:43,265
Rym: Uh, so everyone's smart there went out of their way to remind me Yeah, but Hong Kong's ruined.

24
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,790
Rym: China's gonna completely fuck it over.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,659
Rym: We're all like ready to leave as soon as they finally complete fucking it.

26
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:56,292
Rym: Everyone there I talked to said something to the effect of I wish Britain had gone to war Rather than turn Hong Kong over to China.

27
00:01:56,453 --> 00:02:05,999
Rym: Wow, like people Really don't want China and most of these people are ethnically Chinese but culturally Hong Kong ease.

28
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:06,983
Rym: Hong Kong.

29
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:14,196
Rym: ease culture is closer to New York City culture than it is to mainland China culture Mmm, I get that feeling.

30
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:14,901
Rym: in fact You know what.

31
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:22,647
Rym: New York City culture is closer to Hong Kong than it is to like upstate New York culture Mmm, and and the most fucked up thing.

32
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:29,368
Rym: So I was staying at this super sweet hotel like right in Lfk lkf.

33
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,439
Rym: I keep saying lfk like It's lkf like one I can.

34
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:41,824
Rym: Everyone I knew I met there who wasn't who didn't like grow up speaking a variant of Chinese Can't like.

35
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:44,320
Rym: they know nouns, but they cannot speak Chinese.

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,500
Rym: They have all tried for many many years to learn Cantonese and just can't speak it.

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,310
Rym: But they know all the nouns mostly to rename places.

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,250
Rym: But anyway, so I'm in this lkf area and There's awesome hotel.

39
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,580
Scott: now you're saving this for Thursday.

40
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:01,019
Rym: No, this is one little bit because you know the New York thing.

41
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:15,531
Rym: so I'm walking like in the lobby like across there's like this glass door to the outside and I walked past it and I did what can only be described as a comedy movie like Overly dramatic over acted double-take.

42
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:25,140
Rym: as I stop shake my head Walk backward and look out and sure enough I see the entrance to like the Prince Street and our station.

43
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:33,140
Rym: There is this completely legit, New York City subway station sign complete with like the green like.

44
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,992
Rym: You know that green painted and everything.

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,220
Scott: Oh, is it like a bar?

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,728
Rym: Yeah It's like the entrance to a bar and it's just there.

47
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,071
Rym: my brain was fucked up by that the whole time I was there like every time I saw it.

48
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,000
Rym: My brain was like, oh, I'll just take the subway.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,548
Rym: No, you can't take the subway.

50
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:52,120
Scott: that bar will not take you to your house though, if you get drunk there your brain might go to your.

51
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,667
Rym: But yeah, so I'll tell you about Hong Kong Coming up in the future.

52
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,740
Rym: So in the news now that we're back from the head is the game.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,983
Rym: There's lots of gaming news.

54
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:09,400
Scott: We're not gonna talk about Kojima or PT because we don't know enough about what's going on yet.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:19,404
Rym: We're waiting for the whole story to finish and then boom Yeah in fact The most interesting news I can find is that an insider made a YouTube video kind of talking about it and they made a DMCA Request to pull it down.

56
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,733
Scott: Yeah, so so interesting.

57
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,340
Rym: Yeah, this is such drama.

58
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,460
Rym: Wow, and this is in the backdrop.

59
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:25,801
Rym: This is

60
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,728
Scott: the most drama in video game ever

61
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:42,577
Rym: and remember the backdrop of this crazy drama is multiple Famous and for real important Japanese gaming visionaries all in a relatively short span of time Quitting leaving or variously kick-starting and basically making the games they want to make

62
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,460
Scott: more on that soon.

63
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,700
Scott: Yeah, so, uh, but I do want to point out this Kojima thing.

64
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,669
Scott: This is going to be if you're not paying attention to this.

65
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,100
Scott: This is epic gaming history news, right?

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:02,460
Scott: Like there's certain things in gaming history that are big moments like, you know Square when square gave Nintendo the finger and put Final Fantasy on the PlayStation, right?

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,480
Scott: Well think about how much the world changed like if you were making a timeline of video game.

68
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,940
Scott: You know history, there would be many things on that timeline.

69
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,720
Scott: Kojima fired by Konami is on the list of foot.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,291
Scott: You know things that would make it to the timeline that when it was zoomed way out We don't even 100% know.

71
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,238
Rym: if you like we don't know.

72
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:26,455
Scott: Pretty sure we're gonna find out which is why we're not going into any details until we're 100% sure.

73
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:33,380
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so I guess you got some news related to this related to this topic at least sure.

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:45,300
Scott: So Koji Igarashi a Japanese game developing person who you may or may not have heard of he is a dude who has worked on many many Vania games all one of my favorite kinds of games.

75
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:55,000
Scott: He's like the co-director on Symphony of the Night and then he's sort of like, you know It was the number one person pushing that genre and working on other games like that for many many years.

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:07,860
Scott: so many of the things you like about those types of games are a result of this man's work, so Apparently, you know other the big game companies in Japan don't want to make those kind of games.

77
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,511
Scott: But he recognizes that.

78
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,420
Scott: hey people want to play these kind of games.

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,353
Scott: So he's kick-starting one called blood-stained ritual of the night.

80
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:17,176
Scott: man likes blood.

81
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:21,810
Rym: Oh, yeah It's already raised like seven hundred thousand dollars.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,600
Scott: I kicked it when it was still in like the hundreds.

83
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:26,574
Scott: Yep, because I got brain.

84
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,239
Scott: who's in charge?

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,546
Scott: He's in charge of gaming.

86
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,199
Scott: a Kickstarter tweeted it immediately as soon as it.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,680
Scott: Yeah, and his tweet was so like I didn't realize what it was.

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,142
Scott: He was just like.

89
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,347
Scott: we want to know how.

90
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,318
Scott: his tweet was whip whip whip link and I clicked on it.

91
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,582
Scott: and I'm like Oh Castlevania.

92
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,605
Scott: that explains the whipping.

93
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:46,700
Scott: and then I watched the video and then while I was watching the video I gave them money.

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Rym: Yeah, when I said I didn't even watch the video I scrolled down on the Kickstarter and I saw the concept art and I was like Oh So Sun is a Kickstarter but a miserable pile of Rym spends 40 hours playing this game.

95
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,248
Rym: Like a hundred percent.

96
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,400
Scott: it's only 28 bucks to get a digital copy.

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,712
Rym: 110 percents it in the upside-down castle.

98
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,000
Scott: Yeah, I gave 28 bucks just to get the game.

99
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,847
Rym: That's what I gave.

100
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,426
Scott: is I don't need physical good I don't need any of the garbage.

101
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,560
Rym: one already backed it at the five thousand dollar level.

102
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,754
Scott: Yeah, listen, even if you don't want to like play this game don't.

103
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:24,708
Scott: if you don't want to play it don't kickstart it Right, but come and watch the video.

104
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:28,239
Scott: It isn't one of the excellent Kickstarter videos of all time.

105
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:39,999
Scott: It was the video was helped made by two-player productions who used to do videos or penny arcade I mean pretty much in my opinion like symphony the night number one Dawn of Sorrow number two.

106
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,373
Rym: If anything's gonna dethrone one of those games, it's gonna be this.

107
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:48,850
Rym: I mean, I don't know could suck He might fuck it up, but I'm optimistic.

108
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:54,676
Scott: Yeah, but one thing that our good friend Daryl Surratt pointed out, right?

109
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:58,740
Scott: Oh, wait, let me find is let me find his tweet.

110
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,607
Rym: I think I know what's tweet you're about to say.

111
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,479
Rym: cuz I favorited that tweet cuz I was gonna bring it up.

112
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,431
Scott: Thing about Kickstarter is the big money demand isn't genre driven.

113
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,517
Scott: It's previously established creator driven.

114
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,865
Rym: Oh No, no, that's not true.

115
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:15,818
Rym: A lot of bullshit gets a ton of money because it's purely genre driven.

116
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:16,540
Scott: That is true.

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:29,537
Scott: however, I do want he is true in the case of this one thing because If you look there have been a ton of Vanya like, you know Metroid Vanya genre indie games out in recent years.

118
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:33,655
Scott: We go to PAX You see like ten of these things and they're all pretty mediocre.

119
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:34,720
Scott: They're all kind of mad.

120
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,015
Scott: That's why that they're not raking in big money on Kickstarter is not because of the.

121
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:44,388
Scott: it's not the genre It's not the creator It's the quality.

122
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:52,332
Scott: and it just so happens that someone who's made You know and being the producer director of so many of these is Gonna be able to deliver on the quality.

123
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:57,877
Scott: if we people had the confidence That one of these crappy indie ones is gonna be any good It would also make a bunch of money.

124
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:59,383
Scott: but without it's it.

125
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,210
Scott: the creator doesn't you know, not necessarily.

126
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:10,031
Scott: the fact that their name brings the money is that their name is a Somewhat insurance on the quality that brings the money.

127
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:16,240
Rym: Yeah, if it sucks, you've got a virtual boy Congratulations, you can bitch about it is gonna be hilarious.

128
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,038
Scott: So that's how that's what's going on there?

129
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,700
Rym: I'm like, I'm pretty invested in this game already.

130
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:25,590
Rym: Problem is now I gotta wait for the game.

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,852
Rym: I guess I did, you know, I'm so long Maybe I should just play all the DS ones again.

132
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,300
Rym: I've probably forgotten them by this point.

133
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,434
Scott: I still hadn't didn't beat those GBA ones.

134
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,837
Rym: Oh, yeah Forgot all about those.

135
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,064
Scott: It's quite a few.

136
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:41,819
Rym: thing is I think a DS is just the best one because of how freaking long it is.

137
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,213
Scott: Yeah, well longer the better.

138
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,984
Rym: Yeah I mean not.

139
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:49,259
Rym: not often will I tolerate the like 80 hours of game but with a Vanya that's good.

140
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,488
Rym: I'll tolerate a lot.

141
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,305
Rym: I'll do a lot of things that I would not do Tonight again.

142
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,554
Scott: Yeah, they super Metroid again.

143
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:58,819
Scott: Yeah again again again again.

144
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,351
Rym: This is why with anime with video games with books with everything.

145
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,880
Rym: It's real easy to like start watching.

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,760
Rym: It's like start playing a modern indie game get about a couple hours in and say wow This kind of reminds me of half-life 2. why don't I just go play half-life 2 again?

147
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,339
Scott: Sounds like a good idea.

148
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,170
Rym: Actually, I started playing a half-life 2 again kind of recently just randomly why not?

149
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:27,472
Rym: So in other news remember Freeman when good old games Recently released x-wing and high five.

150
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,100
Scott: I think that's around the last time we did a GeekNights.

151
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:38,536
Rym: Yeah, and that was probably our news and that was huge news because x-wing whatever These are games that are in a genre that is truly dead and while x-wings not a game really like.

152
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:47,167
Rym: to be honest high fighter Might have been what like not what it was one of the best PC games ever Made like that is.

153
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,620
Rym: that is a fact that is not in dispute.

154
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:54,256
Rym: Never forget that high fighter got the highest rating in what PC gamer.

155
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,863
Rym: I think that was the magazine back Ever.

156
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,960
Scott: his game ratings and magazines mean so much Yeah.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,055
Rym: But at the same time like they're in that upper echelon like people were really hesitant to give like the top ratings in case something Better came out the only game that beat it that dethroned.

158
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:12,579
Rym: It was it re-released on CD.

159
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:29,420
Rym: The only complaint we had about these do G packages Is that that re-release not the re re-release and not the original but the middle re-release on CD Was literally the best most perfect iterations of these games ever.

160
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,464
Scott: Yeah, see people don't realize.

161
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:30,625
Scott: see.

162
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,473
Scott: nowadays when a game comes out.

163
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,188
Scott: There's usually not Versions of the game anymore, right?

164
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,272
Scott: The game gets patched.

165
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,220
Scott: So you're always at the newest version.

166
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:47,680
Scott: Yeah, no one like counter-strike go, you know one eight and the patch differences aren't usually noticeable other than bug fixes except in fighting games.

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,015
Scott: They change the rules and usually there's just DLCs adding stuff to a game.

168
00:11:52,436 --> 00:12:00,000
Scott: You don't get like Complete upgrades of games anymore unless they're old games getting HD remakes, right?

169
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,531
Scott: Nintendo be like Wind Waker HD remake.

170
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,760
Rym: but they took tie fire back in the day.

171
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:15,094
Scott: The computer technology was advancing so quickly that even a game that was a year old like doom They just came out with doom again and then doom again again.

172
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:19,872
Scott: It wasn't just like one cop You know, they kept re-releasing it and put making improvements to.

173
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,380
Scott: especially there wasn't really internet then.

174
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,938
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't download how I got doom.

175
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:34,132
Rym: I was literally at a convention and for a dollar I bought a set of floppy disks that had doom Right, so you could get when they patched a game.

176
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,600
Scott: How did they patch the game?

177
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,340
Scott: Well, I mean you could send in to get floppies or something.

178
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,633
Scott: But mostly it's just you didn't get the patch more than I said.

179
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,360
Scott: you went and bought the game again.

180
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,636
Scott: You would get a newer version than your friend who bought the game.

181
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:47,380
Scott: a couple months ago.

182
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,930
Rym: I got a floppy disk in the mail once.

183
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,220
Rym: that was a patch to a fantasy empires.

184
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,234
Scott: Yeah, like the copy of doom that I bought I got doom one on CD.

185
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,016
Scott: now floppy.

186
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:03,194
Scott: Whoa Young motherfucker had the extra episode CD and had the extra episode.

187
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:07,978
Scott: Yeah, I got that later, but CD Yeah, well because what happened is originally right?

188
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,420
Scott: I got doom one just sort of copied from someone else on floppy.

189
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:18,238
Scott: But then when I bought doom one It was already the extra episode edition with the episode for whatever.

190
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:25,062
Rym: it was One of the first four serious games that I got and played a lot was actually xcom and I didn't know software piracy was A thing.

191
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,556
Rym: a friend of mine was like, oh, yeah, I got a computer too.

192
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:29,086
Rym: It's like a nerd guy I met at Space Camp.

193
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:29,710
Rym: He was like, oh here.

194
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:30,857
Rym: Here's some floppies.

195
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,175
Rym: There's a game You should try it and it was just xcom with no instruction manual.

196
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:39,391
Rym: Yeah Years later, I was like, oh that's a game you could buy in the store for money.

197
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:45,029
Scott: Oh Star control - You needed that chart.

198
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:48,737
Rym: Yeah Quest for glory - you need to that giant map.

199
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:51,190
Rym: Yeah So the CD.

200
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,140
Rym: so they really re-release tie fighter.

201
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:57,135
Rym: They doubled the resolution of the renderer to 640 by 480.

202
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,165
Scott: That is a Shit, that's huge.

203
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:00,406
Scott: Fuck.

204
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:08,596
Scott: That's way low res for these days, but it the difference is phenomenal between yeah, and they finish the voice acting.

205
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:13,112
Scott: so Everything has voice acting and the music is the best.

206
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:13,333
Rym: Yep.

207
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,757
Rym: It's still the iMUSE system.

208
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:18,948
Rym: So it's MIDI And it's dynamic like it changes.

209
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,335
Rym: the only game that's done it as well.

210
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:27,384
Rym: Yes as iMUSE was tribes 2 Like no games do it that well there They have like really simple cues.

211
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:34,002
Rym: tribes would like change some of the loops depending on specific things that were going on Nearby.

212
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,688
Rym: you iMUSE did.

213
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,836
Rym: similar things like missiles are coming at you.

214
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,960
Rym: the music get more and more intense.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Rym: you feel like you're in Star Wars, so if you Regardless but no, I don't care if you play these games or not get this edition.

216
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,633
Rym: There is literally no reason not to get.

217
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:51,820
Rym: and you have five bucks.

218
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:52,458
Scott: I mean, come on.

219
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:00,446
Scott: Yeah You care about enough about video games that you're listening to this and you care enough about Star Wars because you're a nerd and if you Don't what the hell I can't high five.

220
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,763
Scott: and you have five bucks because you can afford a device on which to listen to a Podcast.

221
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,149
Scott: so you've got five bucks.

222
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,560
Rym: buy this high fighter is one of the best games ever.

223
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,266
Scott: Is it five bucks?

224
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:09,791
Scott: How much is it?

225
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,598
Rym: I don't know how much it is.

226
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:20,808
Rym: It's also like it was the peak of a genre that died almost immediately after it Like it's a genre that is dead.

227
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:25,140
Rym: And yet the peak of that genre is one of the best video games ever made.

228
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,912
Scott: Looking up the price checking the price checking the price.

229
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:35,624
Rym: So while you're checking the price I've been playing a lot of Civ 5 because I've been flying a lot and Modern airplanes.

230
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,229
Rym: usually at least we're flying overseas.

231
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,012
Rym: Just have holes.

232
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,156
Rym: I can just plug my laptop in.

233
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:48,060
Rym: so Kind of want to play Civ against humans and I figured out how to make pit boss go and I figured out all that shit.

234
00:15:48,602 --> 00:16:00,069
Rym: So if you guys want to play a big game of Civ 5 in the coming weeks I'm gonna try to do a few like let's play multiplayer for four hours just so everyone's kind of like getting pumped and getting into it.

235
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:11,099
Rym: and then I'm probably going to start a Big for real pit boss game of Civ 5 and we you know with the may play by mail Like take your turn whatever and we'll just see where it goes.

236
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,592
Scott: GOG's website is really bad on mobile.

237
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:15,898
Scott: It like basically doesn't even work dude.

238
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,920
Scott: I Would pay 40 bucks and there's a fancy new website - that's pretty shameful.

239
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:27,015
Rym: I would pay 40 bucks if that's it's not 40 bucks It's way less than that, but I would pay 40 or 50 bucks for this game today.

240
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:39,620
Rym: I paid like 74 60 at least when I bought it originally there Things of the day.

241
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:52,765
Rym: So when I was a kid in high school in science Olympiad we had there's an event where you had you got points for like making a giant complex Rube Goldberg machine and For many years in a row.

242
00:16:53,046 --> 00:17:05,984
Rym: they changed the rules every year because we meaning my high school and middle school team Would look at the rules find a loophole and pull some like game breaking bullshit Get the first place.

243
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,296
Rym: and then they changed the rules to specifically disallow the thing we did.

244
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:10,460
Rym: like one year.

245
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:11,573
Scott: It's like the TSA.

246
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:23,719
Rym: Yep like originally like one of the rule it was just Every time you transfer between two types of energy and had like these broad categories of energy like chemical mechanical Electromagnetic like all these different things.

247
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:35,540
Rym: So we made a Rube Goldberg machine and timing was the answer would like it had to finish in a precise amount of time Like two minutes and like raise a flag or ring a bell at another point along the way like one minute.

248
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:54,280
Rym: So the first machine we made we made a mechanical clock with a pendulum that Ticked down exactly one minute and then exactly one more minute in parallel to a really fast and super complex Rube Goldberg machine that finished in like 30 seconds and Then just primed the clock to do its one minute and two minute.

249
00:17:54,761 --> 00:18:00,846
Rym: So we didn't have to do any timing for shit and our machine was a series of like 20.

250
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:12,252
Rym: It was an electric motor connected to another electric motor connected to another another electric motor and our scoring chart was electrical to mechanical to electrical to mechanical to electrical to mechanical to electrical.

251
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:12,794
Rym: mechanical.

252
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:20,200
Rym: big old fucking battery at the end and We definitely broke every spirit of those rules to win that first place.

253
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:26,430
Rym: There's a trend that continued year to year to year and when I was in high school Like senior year when I was a little older.

254
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:36,467
Rym: I needed a reaction Where two clear chemicals would interact and become opaque By a like a laser sensor going through.

255
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:36,547
Scott: Yes.

256
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,716
Rym: Yeah, but it had to be a chemical reaction.

257
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,948
Rym: It couldn't be turbidity It couldn't be like.

258
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,260
Rym: it had to be a chemical reaction.

259
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,303
Scott: Well, you could always just find like some sort of acid or base and then pour in the stuff that turns pink in an acid Or base.

260
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,069
Rym: no because that did so.

261
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,114
Rym: there's a lot of reasons for that.

262
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,740
Rym: It had to turn opaque not translucent.

263
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,920
Scott: This turned sort of dark pink depending how much you know, but it was still translucent.

264
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,104
Rym: It had to be opaque.

265
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,571
Scott: you can have some starchy water and pour in some iodine.

266
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:09,176
Rym: that is not the same kind of reaction Mmm, so what I remember like I was flipping through a chemistry books.

267
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,380
Rym: I never took chemistry in high school.

268
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,659
Rym: I took at the local community college.

269
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:25,280
Rym: So I'm flipping through the high school chemistry book and then I kind of like I noticed the cover and I pull the book cover Off and the cover is a picture of two clear chemicals going into a beaker and turning a bright opaque yellow.

270
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,131
Rym: So I there was no Google really that worked back then.

271
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,720
Rym: so I was like trying to figure out what this reaction was.

272
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:32,727
Rym: I couldn't figure it out.

273
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,760
Rym: I wrote to the publisher like they never responded.

274
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,668
Rym: So I went to the chemistry teacher.

275
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,740
Rym: they even the college the college last resort chemistry teacher.

276
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,814
Rym: Yes, I go to him because I didn't take chemistry like.

277
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,438
Rym: I didn't know him.

278
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:47,175
Rym: So I go to him and I'm like, so what is this reaction?

279
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:50,998
Rym: He's like, I don't know But I'm gonna fucking find out.

280
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:55,040
Rym: So he comes back to me like a month later and he'd figured it out.

281
00:19:55,461 --> 00:20:00,637
Rym: there are two reactions that do that and he couldn't find many other reactions that did it.

282
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:11,688
Rym: and the two reactions are either a cadmium sulfide reaction cadmium sulfide is toxic as shit or a Lead chromate reaction.

283
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,159
Rym: lead chromate is toxic as shit.

284
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:15,426
Scott: It's lead.

285
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:16,149
Scott: It's not know.

286
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,858
Rym: the lead is the least of your worries.

287
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,810
Rym: I'll link to this reaction, but Jesus.

288
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,135
Rym: so I was like.

289
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:23,757
Rym: so he's like.

290
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:24,560
Rym: so why do you want to know?

291
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,139
Rym: That's cool.

292
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,761
Rym: and I was like.

293
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:29,030
Rym: I explained that I needed it for the thing and he said oh awesome.

294
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:42,355
Rym: and He gave me a card that I could use to go to the like the lab check out thing and I got all the stuff To do the lead chromate reaction and we totally used it in our thing Despite it being actually like pretty fucking toxic and dangerous.

295
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:47,614
Rym: you drink it No, but you'd like inhaling it getting like it's not something to play around with.

296
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,237
Rym: I'll link to it.

297
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,367
Rym: So We did the thing and it worked.

298
00:20:52,928 --> 00:21:00,340
Rym: and then in the you know in the scoring the guy scoring us says Oh, so that reaction know what is the actual reaction?

299
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:08,108
Rym: So I explained it to him and he says really I say yes, and he says you're disqualified You're not allowed to do something that dangerous here.

300
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,775
Rym: This is like high school science Olympiad.

301
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:10,960
Rym: Like what's wrong with you?

302
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,518
Rym: Where did you even get this stuff?

303
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:18,880
Rym: and My new my thing of the day is that just recently there's been a breakthrough.

304
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,871
Rym: There is a new way to do this reaction.

305
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:27,139
Rym: That is not toxic using bismuth vanadates.

306
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,832
Scott: Okay, this video that sounds less scary.

307
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:34,440
Rym: This video explains the know that involved and it's this guy.

308
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,207
Rym: It's that awesome, sir.

309
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:36,870
Rym: Palai a cough.

310
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,296
Rym: Yeah our favorite guy.

311
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,220
Rym: He explains it.

312
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,392
Rym: He's like, it's pretty much not toxic like.

313
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:56,024
Rym: I'm not saying you should eat it But if you had to choose between eating it or lead chromate you want to eat Have the lead chromate Rammel tea, so Anyway, I want.

314
00:21:56,164 --> 00:22:00,340
Rym: I was watching this video and then I remembered like this whole Odyssey of high school Olympiad.

315
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,807
Rym: So I give you this video.

316
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:03,369
Rym: enjoy it.

317
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,340
Rym: and now you can turn two clear liquids into an opaque yellow pigment.

318
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,619
Scott: Okay without getting cancer or dying or getting disqualified from the science Olympiad, yes.

319
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:14,785
Rym: So you got a thing of the day.

320
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:20,060
Scott: So here is some sort of town city council meeting somewhere, whatever.

321
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:35,245
Scott: It seems like the mayor whoever the person in charge is gets up and goes to the bathroom and it's like the second in charge person She starts discussing but seems to be a legit issue and she's talking about MRSA.

322
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:41,660
Scott: yeah, like, you know Bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and how people they're starting to spread in their neighborhood.

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:53,131
Scott: she knows people who are getting MRSA and other, you know, horrible C diff and whatnots and How they're gonna basically say hey federal government, you know They're gonna ask the federal government for money to help with this problem, right?

324
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,940
Scott: Because it's a serious problem and it is and she's right.

325
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:56,248
Scott: so.

326
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,399
Scott: But that's not what the video is about.

327
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:05,060
Scott: The video is about the guy who got up because he didn't need to listen to this part and he went to the bathroom.

328
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,425
Scott: Yeah, he left his microphone on.

329
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,829
Rym: Oh, just like Homer Simpson.

330
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:11,237
Scott: Yeah, and that's all there is to it.

331
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:16,808
Rym: I Think the best part about it is well She just starts losing it like in the middle of this very.

332
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,419
Scott: she continues discussing her very serious issue, but she that.

333
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:23,210
Scott: Also, it's funny that there's someone who's opposing her.

334
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:24,596
Scott: It's like why would you oppose this?

335
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,380
Scott: Do you want people to die?

336
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,046
Scott: What's wrong with you?

337
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:26,612
Scott: Mm-hmm?

338
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,387
Rym: Yeah I'll bet it was Republicans.

339
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,472
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

340
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,000
Scott: I don't know which side these people are on.

341
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,378
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say but I'm small town who gives a shit.

342
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,047
Rym: Yeah, small town politics the bathroom parts.

343
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,755
Rym: The important part is the only thing worse than big-town politics.

344
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,320
Scott: There's a few people in that meeting.

345
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,256
Rym: Yeah, it's sad that there aren't more but at the same time I understand why there aren't more.

346
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,247
Scott: cuz I'm not here How many are you going to?

347
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,020
Rym: I try to go to a bunch of beacon?

348
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,054
Rym: But the fucking old people in town always made him at like one o'clock on Wednesday.

349
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,339
Rym: So people with jobs couldn't go.

350
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:03,634
Scott: I was in the park once and someone comes up to me and is like Usually I'm just like giving them the New York ignore, but they're way pushy.

351
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:04,840
Scott: Like where do you live?

352
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,705
Scott: Where do you live?

353
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,798
Scott: you live around here?

354
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:17,500
Scott: And I'm like, no, I live in a story because I was like Greenpoint and they were like if you're lying to me I got to let you know that in that building right now is like a meeting discussing the participatory budgeting.

355
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,244
Scott: You really gotta go.

356
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:21,360
Rym: Oh someone like that grabbed Emily was like, oh you gotta fucking do this.

357
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,115
Rym: And she was again like super scap like, uh-huh, but yeah that thing's legit.

358
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:27,560
Scott: No, it's it's a real thing.

359
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,877
Scott: That's like I don't have to go and sit in this boring meeting right now in a neighborhood.

360
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,359
Scott: I don't live in.

361
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:32,611
Scott: Yeah, get away from me.

362
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:36,167
Scott: I told you no And then another person tried to push me.

363
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:36,690
Scott: and I'm like.

364
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:40,785
Scott: and I'm like when they said, you know I learned the lesson right there.

365
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:41,548
Scott: Like do you live from here?

366
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:42,170
Scott: And you're like.

367
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,936
Scott: no, I'm from Connecticut.

368
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:52,832
Rym: Yeah I'm just like sprock is he - Of course that can fuck you in some places.

369
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,520
Scott: second person was a lot less pushy though.

370
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,953
Rym: In the meta moment, the booklet book is still water ship down.

371
00:24:57,973 --> 00:24:59,200
Rym: It's an epic story of rabbits.

372
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,368
Rym: We don't have any conventions or anything until Connecticut.

373
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,474
Rym: It's nice and chill now and relax.

374
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:09,127
Scott: pegs badges are sold the fuck out So you had about an hour to get them.

375
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:13,720
Rym: Yeah, and you had about 52 seconds to get good hotels or Saturday badges.

376
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:22,307
Rym: Uh Yeah, and that's pretty much it like follow all our internet shit and now that tell the height of scissor done while it's sunny We're gonna be biking a lot.

377
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,280
Rym: There's also gonna be a lot more GeekNights content.

378
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,451
Rym: I'm chewing through the backlog of video editing.

379
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,174
Scott: There you go.

380
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:36,840
Rym: So a Secret to win a fortune in games where numbers are foretold Cut with a scissor small slips of paper on each of which you should write a number.

381
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,888
Rym: You should make as many numbers as you wish.

382
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:42,020
Rym: put all of these slips in a large box such that the numbers are facing down.

383
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:46,459
Rym: Take a spider first to trap it in a glass bottle for a half hour then smash it.

384
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,252
Rym: Say me he prompts it.

385
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,057
Rym: numero per de.

386
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,225
Rym: so What did Kotaku?

387
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:59,842
Rym: Kotaku described this as a mildly satanic video game that you can only play online with real money That's true.

388
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:05,520
Scott: So Jason Rohrer a person we are a big fan of you may know him from such games as passage passage.

389
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:08,968
Scott: Uh sleep is death which people don't know.

390
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:09,690
Scott: sleep is death.

391
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:22,446
Scott: is this two-player sort of RPG thing where one person Can take any action they want really and then the response is another person manually doing the pixels In response to whatever that person does.

392
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,592
Scott: It's really amazing and overlooked.

393
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:35,126
Scott: diamond trust of London castle doctrine Many other smart dude many other games and his current game that he's working on is cordial minuet Which I have been playing.

394
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:36,393
Scott: we've talked about it before.

395
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,600
Scott: we talked about in our PAX South.

396
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,968
Rym: Yeah, I started playing it too.

397
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:43,754
Scott: We talked about I think a little bit before then But now it is officially released.

398
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:48,399
Scott: a hundred percent Totally and I've been playing it for quite a while on and off.

399
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:54,640
Scott: I have a very high yellow ranking, but I haven't made a lot of money because I don't take risks in big-money games.

400
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,315
Rym: I haven't played it as much but I've been playing when I do play.

401
00:26:57,556 --> 00:27:04,262
Rym: I've been playing one to two orders of magnitude higher stakes than Scott Probably less games.

402
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,106
Rym: Yeah, I've been betting ones of dollars.

403
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:11,503
Scott: I've been betting ones of cents and tens of cents a Few times.

404
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:20,714
Scott: one time I played a big dollar game like four or five bucks I lost and another time I played a big game for five bucks I won and I'm around $19 and change and I put in 20 bucks to start.

405
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:25,972
Scott: so I'm down profit wise But my elo ranking is like six or eight plays or something.

406
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,136
Scott: I mean a lot of games.

407
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:31,676
Scott: They're just so low money They can't make up for my like losing that one one dollar game a long time ago.

408
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,298
Rym: I put in 15 bucks.

409
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:39,541
Scott: I'm at like 1380 right now I gotta play some games against Rym where he bets like a couple bucks and then I can just get back up into the profit Zone.

410
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:40,364
Rym: Yeah, we'll see though.

411
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:41,668
Rym: What if I win right?

412
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,777
Scott: So this game here is basically how this game works.

413
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:59,740
Scott: Imagine if You're playing rock-paper-scissors But the rock-paper-scissors was not equal like rock 140 percent of the time and scissors was 20 percent of the time and paper was the other rest of the right.

414
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:00,985
Scott: But not only that.

415
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,652
Scott: there's a lot more than three choices.

416
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,640
Scott: There's like 12 choices.

417
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:09,481
Scott: Well, there's six choices really but you give one to you and one to your opponent and then you do it again one

418
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:09,701
Rym: two

419
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:23,526
Scott: of the remaining four choices and then the remaining two choices one for you and one for them and wherever the intersections are is the score and is a higher score wins and you bet after every move just like poker and You see who wins.

420
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:26,642
Scott: you get the moneys and That's what this game is.

421
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:33,418
Rym: Yeah, this is a game of perfect skill and Perfect arbitrary like it.

422
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:34,469
Rym: It's just.

423
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:41,900
Rym: it's a game where you Bang your brain against someone else and based on the combined decisions you to make one of you wins a bunch of money.

424
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:46,395
Rym: You have to bet real money to real cash money you.

425
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:47,760
Scott: there is no tutorial.

426
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:50,872
Scott: There is no video that gives you tutorial.

427
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:52,900
Rym: Yeah, but you know, there's no playable you tutorial.

428
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:59,560
Scott: There's a YouTube video tutorial and the way it works is you put real cash money in with your credit card.

429
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:16,320
Scott: It goes into Jason roars bank account where it collects interest to who knows what right and he gives you digital money with which to Play the game which you can withdraw at any time of course into real money again, and then you play the game with the digital real money and When you create a game or join a game these the value of the game is already set.

430
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,080
Scott: So you might see like someone wants to play a 10-cent game you click on it.

431
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,726
Scott: You're now playing a 10-cent game.

432
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:29,799
Scott: or you can say us you can say start a game and you can set the amount of money For the game equal to or less than the amount of money you have in the virtual bank.

433
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,420
Scott: No, then both players go into that game with a hundred chips.

434
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,045
Scott: You can leave the game.

435
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:40,239
Scott: if you leave the game early you give the person the ante for the next game.

436
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,718
Scott: Matt You know round you didn't play.

437
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:49,346
Scott: So leaving means losing some amount of chips, but each chip is worth one 200th of the initial pot.

438
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:53,300
Scott: so if you play a $2 game each chip is exactly one cent.

439
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:59,280
Scott: Alright, and after eat the first round you're forced to bet one chip both players.

440
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:03,719
Scott: So even if you both even if you fold immediately you lose that one chip.

441
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:14,020
Rym: so then I pick a row for you and I pick a row for me and Then it reveals the wall row that the other person picked for you But not the row they picked for yourself for themselves, right?

442
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:24,655
Scott: so I pick a row for them and they pick a row for me and And so I see the intersection of the row I picked for myself and the row they picked for me and I know the value that I have.

443
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:27,244
Scott: it's some number on this grid This magic square.

444
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,508
Rym: Yeah, we do it three times.

445
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:32,200
Rym: So you basically you and them each score three boxes, right?

446
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,312
Scott: So, you know which possibilities they have.

447
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:44,580
Scott: it gets narrowed down over time But you're never a hundred percent sure until the very very end What their exact number is and along the way they play?

448
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:56,480
Scott: Well, they can set it up such to where when you look at what possible numbers they could have They could have very high or they could have very low But all your values are sort of stuck in the middle.

449
00:30:56,922 --> 00:31:01,846
Scott: So, you know, so it's like they know whether they're beating you or not But you don't know.

450
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,413
Scott: you just know that well 50/50 they're beating me to lose them I don't know.

451
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:13,592
Rym: so in between every one of these after it's revealed how many points you got then you can Blind like simultaneously bet more money.

452
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,220
Scott: So the betting is tricky, right?

453
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,888
Scott: it's not like poker where it goes around.

454
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:22,380
Scott: you bet without knowing what they're betting and Those chips that you bet go in well.

455
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:28,540
Rym: Whoever bid less has to either match right other person bid or fold.

456
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:39,121
Scott: But let's say I bid 10 and you bid 20. right you have an opportunity fold on 20 But I lose those 10 because I didn't get to see that you put in the 20 until my 10 were already taken away from Me.

457
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:46,102
Scott: so now my choice is well put 10 more or fold as opposed to poker where it would be Rym would put in 20.

458
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,207
Scott: I would get the information.

459
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,754
Scott: then my turn I fold.

460
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,120
Scott: it's a simultaneous bet.

461
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:58,780
Rym: so if you make it all the way to the end and neither player is folded then the last choice is you choose one of Your score box is to reveal to the other person, right?

462
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,893
Scott: So once you get after that final reveal of that final number, right?

463
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,240
Scott: Even though you're not choosing you already know your final score.

464
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,089
Scott: I'm sure I know theirs.

465
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,512
Scott: Yeah, right that final reveal Sometimes doesn't matter based on the numbers that have been played.

466
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:22,160
Scott: but that final reveal now You know, they're they have one of two possible scores and narrows it down that much before all betting is over.

467
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Rym: I have once or twice gotten someone to not fold and bid a bunch by revealing a surprisingly low number.

468
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:42,524
Scott: Well, if someone reveals a low number, right it can't like it caps their max possible score obviously But you can see plainly if they reveal a low number and they have a high possible score left it's because they were hiding their big numbers.

469
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,205
Scott: obviously right.

470
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:54,380
Scott: if they reveal a high number and You look at their possible scores and there's a really low possibility It's like oh they revealed the high number to create this divergent appearance.

471
00:32:54,683 --> 00:33:02,565
Rym: So I get the impression That a lot of people who play this game at least at the very low stakes because there's another clever thing They don't know what's going on.

472
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:09,470
Rym: The game has a really clever like score description UI element on the right.

473
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:23,940
Rym: that sort of shows all the Mathematically possible numbers that your opponent could think you have that are possible in any fashion and it shows you Every possible score that the opponent could have based on the information you have.

474
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:31,708
Rym: So basically it removes like a reasonable percentage of like the tedious calculation You'd have to do to be good at this.

475
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,620
Scott: There are still some things you have to do though.

476
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,833
Scott: It's like it does so much calculation for you, but there's still more right.

477
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:40,240
Rym: the most boring calculations You can focus on the more interesting, right?

478
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:52,723
Scott: so you can hover over numbers on the grid with your mouse and it will give you information if you know how to read It such as what would the possibilities be if this number will became yours Right.

479
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:57,780
Scott: So it's like well if I got this number my score would be this and my opponent would see these possibilities, right?

480
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:09,232
Scott: so you can sort of see a turn into the future what the possibilities are to help you decide what to pick and It's very very interesting that way because it's actually something people don't realize.

481
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:12,080
Scott: this is like the first basic strategy of the game.

482
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:23,719
Scott: It is possible and in fact it happens in a somewhat surprising percentage of the games I play in fact, I'd say maybe 25% of the rounds at in which before the final pick.

483
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,829
Scott: So after the second reveal.

484
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:31,248
Scott: if you look at the grid and study it You can easily figure out within.

485
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,356
Scott: I can do it in about 20 seconds at this point, right?

486
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:41,840
Scott: I can figure out Whether or not it is definitely a hundred percent guaranteed that I'll win or lose.

487
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,286
Scott: It's like it's or after the second reveal.

488
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:58,508
Scott: So the third picks haven't even been made but you can at that point oftentimes Determine with this board in this configuration no matter what pick they make and no matter what pick I make in the in the third pick I'm going to lose or I'm going to win no matter what.

489
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:10,057
Scott: and at that point if you make that calculation and figure out it's One of those rounds you can either a fold immediately because you know, you've lost no matter what Yeah, or B just go all-in because they haven't realized it yet.

490
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:15,878
Scott: Most likely Right, and if they know if they're as good as you they were gonna fold right.

491
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,325
Scott: then anyway No matter what you bet.

492
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:18,048
Scott: So what's?

493
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,440
Scott: you might as well go all-in instead of 10 or 20?

494
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,226
Rym: That's one thing I've noticed.

495
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,940
Scott: and if they don't know any better Well, I mean, maybe you could have lured them in with a lower bet.

496
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:27,584
Scott: I don't know.

497
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:33,811
Rym: in a higher stakes game if I just go all-in Most of the time my opponent folds very very quickly.

498
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,300
Scott: Well, that's because they got a shitty score, right?

499
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Rym: Yeah, but I'll go all-in like semi-randomly and people almost always fold.

500
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,338
Scott: Bluffing in this game is huge.

501
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:52,744
Scott: Right because if you can get a bluff win You can get way out ahead of your opponent really fast because if you have the upper hand in chips You are in a very strong position to just take the rest of theirs Regardless of what gets picked.

502
00:35:52,784 --> 00:36:03,560
Scott: right because you can start raising on every round no matter what and if they don't have a good hand It's like they have to fold because if they go for it, they just lose everything they have left.

503
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,047
Scott: They've only got like 20 chips left, right?

504
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,740
Scott: They need to win on like an all-in to get back into the game.

505
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,048
Scott: So we get the upper hand in chips.

506
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:18,417
Scott: You can just bully your opponent a lot So that you know gives that kind of strong strategy there regardless of the picking that goes on.

507
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:25,045
Rym: Yeah But in general like just playing this game it's Surprisingly addictive.

508
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:29,780
Scott: Yeah, because it's it gives you that and not because you want to win the real money.

509
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,534
Scott: No, I'm paying for ten cents.

510
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:32,180
Scott: I don't give a shit.

511
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,480
Rym: Game theory game like this.

512
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,549
Scott: There is nothing in my mind that has like a fit.

513
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,790
Scott: like you go into a casino and you pull a slot machine which can be Addictive to even the smartest person and it's like.

514
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:49,260
Scott: but that's because you have in your mind this fantasy of like ooh This jackpot might come out But this time I know there's no fantasy of a jackpot coming out.

515
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,604
Rym: I'm trying to do like a poor man's minimax in my head Like I'm trying to like.

516
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,274
Rym: do that, you know, which cup should I some people.

517
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:57,760
Scott: some people use spreadsheets.

518
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:02,824
Scott: Some people wrote their own client apps even right just like because it's just an open It's you can.

519
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:04,715
Scott: there's no copyright in the code, right?

520
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:05,640
Scott: Everything's on the server.

521
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,388
Scott: It's like you can just write your own client.

522
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,700
Scott: You can just look at the all the source.

523
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,421
Rym: Yeah, whatever Jason say we asked him something like packs Like.

524
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:16,156
Rym: does he care if people like try to write bots to solve it with game theory?

525
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:20,517
Rym: There was a lot Yeah, and he's like, yeah, I still make a cut like I don't care go nuts.

526
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:21,160
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

527
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,670
Scott: So every round of the game so you go into a game against someone and as long as no one leaves You're playing until one person holds all the remaining chips.

528
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,439
Scott: now each round that you play when the pot pays out Jason roar takes one chip.

529
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:47,500
Scott: So if you takes if you're playing like really going against someone and he goes deep into the game round after round after round And no one's won yet He's taking more and more chips away out of that game and he's happy times.

530
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,880
Scott: He's getting more money's right like imagine if you're playing a big-time game thousands of dollars.

531
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,898
Scott: Each one of those chips is only one two hundredth.

532
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,509
Scott: So if you play a two thousand dollar game.

533
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:08,040
Scott: each chip is like ten bucks But at the same time he's making ten bucks every round and also the ante increases every round.

534
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,165
Scott: So I play against Rym.

535
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:09,908
Scott: we play a grid.

536
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:11,474
Scott: right we have to.

537
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,000
Scott: we must ante one chip.

538
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:17,059
Scott: We can obviously go all in right away It doesn't matter but we're putting in at least one chip each.

539
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:21,395
Scott: Then the next round two then the next three then four then five.

540
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:27,067
Scott: so the deeper you get in You can't play Conservatively because you're basically forced to bet.

541
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:31,600
Scott: like is the 20th round against this guy have to put in 20 chips, right?

542
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:38,376
Scott: So it gets really rough if you're just like if you fall behind a little bit and start playing conservatively just to hold on folding a lot.

543
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,709
Scott: cuz eventually it's Like well, I got I got the one on the first go fold.

544
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,775
Scott: I just lost like 20 chips.

545
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:45,397
Scott: Fuck.

546
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:51,135
Scott: Yeah, right It's like you have to play aggressively and really go after your opponent no matter how many.

547
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:53,346
Scott: but you've got going on But it's hard to do.

548
00:38:53,386 --> 00:39:03,615
Scott: Like I said before when you have low chips You can't go after someone who's betting a lot because you're basically staking it all in that one game suddenly Whoa, random aside looks like a bull bus exploded.

549
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:07,149
Rym: No It was the way to Boston - it's the one we would usually take.

550
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,112
Scott: no look at that.

551
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:09,818
Rym: It literally just exploded.

552
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,745
Scott: Wow Bam was people on it.

553
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,632
Rym: I think they ran off the bus.

554
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:15,876
Rym: I can't tell what's going on.

555
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:18,815
Scott: Whoa Wow, and I was so safe.

556
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:19,379
Rym: Oh, look at that.

557
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:23,517
Scott: I was having such good times on this safe bolt bus, but maybe you want this to be you.

558
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,632
Scott: Maybe I should stop taking the boat bus Amtrak's not that much more expensive.

559
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:29,600
Scott: That's the first accident bolt buses ever had.

560
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,208
Rym: I think they've had a couple more.

561
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:32,172
Scott: I don't know but that's.

562
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,720
Rym: I was stuck on a bolt bus.

563
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:34,483
Scott: It wasn't.

564
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,410
Scott: it wasn't like a crash accident, right?

565
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:37,816
Scott: It was just the bus.

566
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:38,860
Scott: I thought those are well maintained.

567
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:39,744
Scott: I guess I've been lied.

568
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,415
Rym: I don't think any coach buses are well maintained.

569
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:45,045
Scott: So said ah First comment.

570
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:45,570
Rym: Yeah fun.

571
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,537
Rym: Well still looks bad.

572
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,726
Rym: Anyway, that was an aside.

573
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,080
Rym: that's a New York decide right because we use the bolt bus to go to Pax's.

574
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:58,017
Scott: So now, you know the Rym just reads the Internet's while he's doing the show here.

575
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:02,080
Scott: Yeah So there's a lot of other things going on in this game, right?

576
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:12,518
Scott: So the theme of the game is sort of like this dark underground like satanic Like you've been invited into a secret society because you secret gambling day, you know things.

577
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:15,926
Rym: Yeah Well, I mean like we talked about in our pack show.

578
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:20,580
Rym: his booth at Pax was like this gypsy like mystery gambling day.

579
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:21,348
Scott: That's a racist word.

580
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:21,591
Scott: racist.

581
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:24,629
Rym: Look like a gypsy cap.

582
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,194
Rym: It was cool.

583
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:25,980
Scott: Gypsy's a race.

584
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:33,580
Rym: It should be like a Romani time Yeah, but I don't want to impose this satanic gambling game upon the actual Romani people.

585
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,430
Scott: That's why but it's just.

586
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:42,440
Scott: the tent was in their stylings But it was actually a tent in the style of the fortune teller from Laura linked to the past.

587
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:51,338
Rym: But inside it was like this cyberpunk dystopia with these like raw Lzd monitors with like ribbon cables coming out of them to play the game on.

588
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:56,180
Scott: Yep This is the style of the game accounts for live is the boring like minesweeper grid?

589
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:57,970
Scott: You wouldn't really be wanting to play this.

590
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:05,260
Rym: Yeah, the games like it had and you know, he's made You know the gong that we do a lot of lectures about like game design and UX and all these things.

591
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:12,260
Rym: Jason Rohrer is one of the few people on earth where I have really nothing bad at all to say about any of his works

592
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:19,030
Scott: And all his works are like completely new and ingenious and fresh But like any other thing that came before that all the

593
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:24,053
Rym: things that I make tired complaints about with other games Like he's got that shit down flawlessly like

594
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:24,917
Scott: simple

595
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:25,500
Rym: little things.

596
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,840
Rym: Like he uses the metaphor of like paper in the game, right?

597
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,513
Rym: Like it's a piece of parchment and you put ink on it.

598
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:39,700
Rym: like green ink shows the air Like the place you took and red ink shows the other persons and the ink never goes away.

599
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,144
Rym: Like it doesn't preview.

600
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:45,615
Rym: showing you ink when you're making your decision you move a marker outside the board.

601
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:47,680
Rym: ink is permanent on the paper.

602
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:50,509
Rym: Yep little things like that.

603
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:57,033
Rym: the UI and the UX are so Consistent and just so well thought out in these very nuanced ways.

604
00:41:57,394 --> 00:41:59,180
Scott: So let's talk about some basic strategies.

605
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:06,761
Scott: So the most basic strategy there is is to give your opponent the row that has the lowest possible Number.

606
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,268
Scott: basically keep their score down, right?

607
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,433
Scott: So, you know the maximum score they could have.

608
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:14,040
Scott: meanwhile pick for yourself either.

609
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,019
Scott: You can figure out your opponent's behavior and therefore, you know They're gonna pick the shittiest row for you.

610
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,807
Scott: So pick the highest number of the shitty thing.

611
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:24,739
Rym: you already went one step beyond your first heuristic, right?

612
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:24,799
Scott: or?

613
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:28,351
Scott: Just pick a row with high variance.

614
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:33,953
Scott: if you pick a row with high variance You're mathematically speaking because all the rows and columns add up to the same number.

615
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:34,997
Scott: It's a magic square, right?

616
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:42,320
Scott: Yeah, so You can sort of pick a row with high variance and it's like you might get a really low score.

617
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:48,120
Scott: You might get a really high score, but your opponent sees both possibilities because you picked a row with high variance.

618
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:52,500
Scott: So the result of that is you're keeping your opponent's score down.

619
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,751
Scott: So they don't have a big number to be confident with that.

620
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:56,554
Scott: They're gonna beat you.

621
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,991
Scott: and when they look at your possibilities It's like well could be big could be small.

622
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,020
Scott: You might have six you might have a hundred.

623
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:06,299
Scott: They don't freaking know right?

624
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,556
Scott: it's like sort of a coin toss for them which makes them nervous.

625
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:12,266
Scott: and Then you can convince them with your betting.

626
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:23,424
Scott: if you are being contained by your opponent sort of into this middle-of-the-road score It's like well you might win with that if they were really if you can force them into a really shitty score But you don't have the.

627
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,560
Scott: how do you have the confidence to bet when they could have a really high score and they're betting big?

628
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,306
Scott: It's like oh, what do you do?

629
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:32,557
Scott: Yeah, so that's the most basic of strategies.

630
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:33,600
Scott: There are other strategies.

631
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:42,340
Scott: For example, let's say you see a row and that row has like 36 and 34 and it like these two big numbers like those are 36 is the biggest number on the grid, right?

632
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,244
Scott: It's a six by six grid one to 36.

633
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:47,781
Scott: You don't want them to get the 36.

634
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:51,280
Scott: They're probably gonna win with that unless you give them two really crappy numbers to go with it.

635
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:59,120
Scott: But because it has the 36 and another over 30 number that row the rest of the numbers are gonna be really shitty.

636
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:10,982
Scott: So it's like well if they pick this row, you know I'd give them this row if they pick randomly they have a four out of six chance of getting something really really shitty Right.

637
00:44:11,744 --> 00:44:19,049
Scott: So I'll give them that and maybe they'll get lucky and get the one of the two that are over 30 But most likely four out of six chance.

638
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:20,453
Scott: They're gonna get a really bad number.

639
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:25,070
Scott: Yeah, and if they're stuck with that well You know, I'm probably gonna.

640
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,399
Scott: they're breaking a fold right away.

641
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,692
Scott: No If I bet a little bit or who knows where right.

642
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:41,980
Scott: so you can give them that kind of row Bet and if they see you or they bet also you can be pretty sure they got one of those 30s unless they're really really smart Betting it up when they've got a shitty number course.

643
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,943
Rym: Then you use that.

644
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:49,200
Rym: if you assume that they got like the 30 then you know that they can't use that row again.

645
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,153
Rym: Yeah in the next two rounds Dale.

646
00:44:52,374 --> 00:44:53,480
Scott: So you they pick a row.

647
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,960
Scott: They've eliminated all these other possibilities from the game.

648
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:00,696
Scott: So, you know you give them this row and the good number in that row is 36, right?

649
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,541
Scott: And they let's say you're pretty sure they got the 36.

650
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:12,069
Scott: Well, if you're pretty sure about that then you know that in this these other numbers across the board They can't get those on the second pick.

651
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,661
Scott: and you see that they've eliminated by picking the 36.

652
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:18,360
Scott: They've eliminated like the 28 from this other choice.

653
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:24,579
Scott: It's like well I'll give you that row that no longer has a 28 in it because the rest of the numbers in aren't that great.

654
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:27,411
Scott: And then they also they give you a row.

655
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:32,200
Scott: so they give you a row and now it's like well They gave me that row which means they didn't take it for themselves.

656
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:36,756
Scott: So they can't possibly have any of those numbers and they've eliminated the 30 from that one.

657
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,739
Scott: So I'll give them that one that no longer has a 30 in it and has a really shitty numbers remaining.

658
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:52,235
Rym: Now I found that a lot of one of the strategies I use in low stakes games It seems highly effective is I kind of assume my opponent's dumb and has a pretty simple strategy.

659
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,603
Rym: So I move quickly and The first round I assume that they're gonna do something dumb Like they.

660
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:03,440
Rym: they're going for the 36, you know, these look really like there's like the really simplest heuristics baby mode.

661
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:10,079
Rym: so assuming someone's dumb and doing that I Maximize the harm to them by making that choice.

662
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:21,055
Rym: and then it's immediately obvious if that works in the first round then I play super Aggressively and super fast and bit a lot and I just kind of bowl them over and win

663
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:31,227
Scott: a lot of the game is Figuring out because if you just try to play randomly rock-paper-scissors wise right that is not going to work Right in rock-paper-scissors.

664
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:32,291
Scott: You want to play randomly?

665
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:32,612
Scott: Why?

666
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:34,620
Scott: because all three choices are equally power.

667
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:37,700
Rym: You do still want to play randomly, but you want to play with a mixed strategy.

668
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,300
Scott: You want to play like not all strategies in this game are equally powerful, right?

669
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,090
Scott: There's a really strong rock and sort of a weaker scissor and a ball.

670
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,956
Rym: choices are not even so what you.

671
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:49,806
Rym: so a mixed strategy would be.

672
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:59,199
Rym: like 60% of the time I'm going to you know not choose the row with the 36 because reasons I'm gonna use this other kind of row in my first pick.

673
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:05,338
Rym: Yeah Or like 20% of the time I'll choose a low variance row in the first round because the board is different.

674
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:08,347
Scott: the actual Variance numbers change round to round.

675
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:12,439
Scott: that is sometimes boards are just unfavorable to one or the other player.

676
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:13,604
Scott: But you can.

677
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:21,254
Scott: sometimes you can look at a board from turn one and be like, oh wow I can just totally corral them in no matter what they pick right.

678
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:24,007
Scott: It's like in order for them to beat these picks They would have to make that pick.

679
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,040
Scott: but then picks two and three they're hosed.

680
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:28,591
Scott: So and if they don't pick that on turn one, they're hosed.

681
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,480
Scott: Anyway, this board is just good for me.

682
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:32,300
Scott: I'll just bet it way up on the first pick.

683
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:38,819
Rym: Yeah, like sometimes what I'll do is if there's a row that has very little variance is all like middle-of-the-road numbers.

684
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,159
Rym: Sometimes what I'll do is I'll give that to myself on the first round because they can't basically like they can't

685
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,473
Scott: hurt me Hose you out on the first round

686
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:57,427
Rym: and then the Choices like making my choice and doing my calculation of the next two rounds super easy at that point because I have there's so few decisions left to make.

687
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:09,179
Rym: so I can think of it in terms of Two row choices high score low score like these positions and I can sort of based on their behavior figure out like oh They tend to when they're behind do this kind of thing.

688
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,620
Scott: Yeah, it's all about you know, figuring because your opponent is always a human being right?

689
00:48:14,903 --> 00:48:16,840
Scott: They have some sort of logic.

690
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,349
Scott: You can always also think what would I do if I were them?

691
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:26,644
Scott: and there's there are situations where it's not just poison cup because the math Unbalances the poison cup.

692
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:31,460
Scott: It's like wow, they would be stupid to make this pick because they just lose if they make that pick.

693
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,100
Scott: So really they're only making one of these two choices.

694
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:39,676
Scott: Which one would I make if I was them based on their past behavior in previous rounds?

695
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:40,860
Scott: Which one are they likely to pick?

696
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:46,040
Scott: Oh, look if I pick this row that's kind of hoses them on either of those two choices.

697
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:54,639
Scott: I have to pick that one and I'll get this one and then it usually turns out that you're right and You'll see that the other players can also do this to you.

698
00:48:55,041 --> 00:49:04,213
Scott: You'll often see like in the last round, you know when there's only like two, you know There's only like two numbers two columns left because there's only two things to pick.

699
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,980
Scott: you'll see like there'll be one row.

700
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:10,840
Scott: But there's only two shitty numbers available and it's like they're gonna give me that one, aren't they?

701
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:20,360
Scott: I'm gonna get a shitty number now no matter what right right and yes Nine times out of ten that shitty row that only had two shitty numbers left goes to you and it didn't matter what you pick.

702
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:29,340
Scott: However, if they don't do that like if they do well The only way they wouldn't do that is if that had given themselves that row already in one of the earlier two picks.

703
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:31,802
Scott: Yeah, but if they're a good player They haven't.

704
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:32,344
Scott: they knew.

705
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:33,368
Scott: that's how it was gonna work.

706
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:39,288
Scott: and those other two numbers that you've taken in that row They know those are already beneath what I was getting.

707
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:41,817
Rym: that I can tell it makes like an obviously dumb decision.

708
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:45,159
Rym: more than once They're a keeper and I saw I'm playing this game to the end.

709
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:49,700
Scott: It's all about figuring out your opponent's behavior in those early rounds.

710
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,628
Scott: It's always full advantage.

711
00:49:51,648 --> 00:49:53,135
Rym: smart in the early round no matter

712
00:49:53,175 --> 00:50:08,060
Scott: how smart you are There is some pattern to your behavior in some strategy because if you don't have any kind of strategy if you play Super randomly you will just lose to someone who plays sort of the greatest win percentage chance rose.

713
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:17,020
Scott: Yeah, if you there's you can just play the best chance of winning rose Against a random bot and you will come out on top like money-wise 60% or something like that.

714
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:19,228
Scott: So you cannot just play randomly.

715
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,975
Scott: you have to have some sort of.

716
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:26,159
Scott: you have to at least Play best odds of winning choices if no other kind of choice.

717
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:31,900
Scott: But if you play best odds of winning and your opponent knows you always play best odds of winning they can just destroy you.

718
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:38,150
Scott: You have to mix it up and therefore it forces you to do Poison cup with math.

719
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,034
Scott: add it on to it.

720
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,360
Scott: Not just straight poison cup.

721
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:46,619
Rym: So it's super fun and you should probably put just not mean think put like five bucks in.

722
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,791
Scott: There's no reason to spend a lot of money.

723
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:49,920
Scott: You can play penny games.

724
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:57,605
Rym: Yeah, right think think of that five bucks as that's what you paid for the game, right and just don't lose all your money And just try it out.

725
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,753
Scott: It's if you have problems with gambling.

726
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:01,078
Scott: There are places you can call for that.

727
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:02,724
Scott: It's an Interesting like.

728
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:03,728
Scott: it's not a variance.

729
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,299
Rym: There aren't other games like it?

730
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:14,153
Rym: No that's for sure and I'm curious if anyone is going to put any like Game theory math behind it to try to come up with an optimal play strategy.

731
00:51:14,293 --> 00:51:16,200
Scott: Also, it's really I just came out now.

732
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,119
Scott: It's hot now.

733
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,545
Scott: There's like a launch contest.

734
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:18,986
Scott: now.

735
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:24,946
Scott: if you're gonna play it play it now because this is the kind of game that could easily not Have any players after some amount of time.

736
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:26,129
Rym: also, you know poker.

737
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:34,520
Rym: if poker gets really popular like one month because there's a big thing On TV, that's when you want to play a bunch of poker because a whole bunch of noobs are playing poker.

738
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:36,239
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna get some money out of them.

739
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:41,700
Rym: You don't want to play poker when the only people in the room are all wearing sunglasses and are obviously poker pros.

740
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:42,847
Rym: Just just leave.

741
00:51:42,928 --> 00:51:44,800
Scott: Yeah also the forum for this game.

742
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,319
Scott: You need to go there if you're playing it more than just once to see what it is.

743
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:51,640
Scott: Go and sign up for the forum for this game and read the threads.

744
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,420
Scott: There is important informations in there to learn a lot of things.

745
00:51:56,162 --> 00:52:07,670
Scott: Many things need to be learned from those forums many discussions leaderboards all sorts of stuff That if you want to make any sort of winning strategy You need to go check that out and see what other people are talking about.

746
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:20,600
Rym: and in a closing note blood-stained ritual of the night raised 70,000 more dollars since we mentioned it on the show earlier, you know, I've been watching this tally count up.

747
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:27,080
Scott: I mean people pay a lot of money just for an original copy of Symphony of the Night on a disc.

748
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:30,500
Scott: Why wouldn't they pay 28 bucks for a digital copy of modern?

749
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:38,194
Scott: Probably a lot of people as good game at high levels - well, you know, they really like.

750
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:40,000
Rym: I mean eight people gave him two grand.

751
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:41,507
Scott: What do you get for two grand?

752
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:42,391
Rym: What do you get for two?

753
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:44,260
Rym: for two grand you get the game?

754
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,849
Scott: I hope runic forging.

755
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,799
Rym: I guess that's the name of that thing.

756
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:51,413
Rym: Okay, collaborate with the development team to create an in-game weapon.

757
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:52,677
Rym: All right, that's cool.

758
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:53,420
Rym: That'd be cool.

759
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:56,120
Rym: I would make some like bullshit little stabby dagger.

760
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:04,900
Scott: I would make See what like throwing weapons because they don't get used enough, but I'd make it throwing up and it's actually used a lot.

761
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:19,180
Rym: Well, like in Dawn of Sorrow my my go-to as soon as I got all the good weapons I'd always have cuz you know the two hands I'd have the slowest Most fucking damage like the giant axe and my other weapon is the fastest weakest weapon.

762
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,361
Scott: You know.

763
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:30,340
Scott: what I would do is I would make a bow and arrow or crossbow that could actually be fired rapidly in all eight Directions, but was only mid was strong enough to matter but not ridiculously strong.

764
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:33,820
Scott: So you'd be better off using an unwieldy weapon for just damage.

765
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:46,100
Scott: So but it would really be good to use in a lot of those rooms or bad guys come from all sorts of directions if you have skills because you can Actually hit them as opposed to trying to like dodge out of the way so you could hit him with your clumsy sword.

766
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,407
Scott: That's what I would do like a metal blade basically.

767
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,052
Rym: Yeah, you and your metal blade.

768
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:51,316
Rym: metal blade was way OP.

769
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:52,440
Scott: That's the point.

770
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:56,320
Scott: Yeah less powerful than metal blade though, but still with the directions and the control.

771
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:04,670
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
