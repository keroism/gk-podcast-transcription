1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,320
Rym:

2
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:12,409
Scott: It's it's it's.

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,862
Rym: it's Thursday July 21st 2016.

4
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:29,540
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights still recovering from the illness that laid us low last week and tonight We're talking about garments and clothes and to a degree fashion.

5
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:31,638
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:45,617
Rym: So those of you who do follow the patreon I did a thing a while ago where I explained something I'm doing and With when I bike and I am Literally still calling the police on every single car I ever encounter when I'm biking.

7
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:46,640
Rym: That's blocking a bike lane.

8
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:54,940
Rym: It's actually working pretty well, so I've noticed something pretty interesting Even if it's the police you call.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,999
Scott: Hmm, even if it's a police car.

10
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:15,305
Rym: Yes, actually, I've reported for police cars and they did like I did hang around once There over the holiday weekend 4th of July weekend and what I saw is eventually this other cop car rolls up and They talked to each other a little bit and then both cop cars drove away Because it's 311.

11
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:19,980
Rym: So even if like they don't want to do something the complaint goes through all this bureaucracy.

12
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:22,880
Rym: So like that I get all these updates.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,930
Rym: It's like all the updates to the ticket and what happened and everything.

14
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:34,400
Rym: So I get this sort of like fascinating view inside Cops who may maybe don't care but there's a thing that's gonna bother them until they go do it.

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,195
Scott: Why don't you go post about this in bike right and be like, hey this works.

16
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,020
Scott: Maybe you get a hole.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,127
Rym: Well, I'm expanding a little bit.

18
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,260
Rym: So John Kelly is joining me now in the crusade.

19
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:45,516
Rym: So he's doing it too because you think we bike hardcore John our friend John.

20
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,420
Scott: All he does is buy.

21
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,828
Scott: Yeah, like he is does he even have a job?

22
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:50,835
Rym: Uh, I don't know what.

23
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:54,311
Rym: I never knew what he did for a living Other than being a really good photographer and biker.

24
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:59,173
Rym: Yeah and such Being a side character being cooler than everyone else.

25
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,660
Rym: Yeah, he's pretty he's a cool, dude.

26
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:16,619
Rym: But what I noticed and it's only anecdotal so far but after I started doing this for several weeks, I Basically almost never encounter cars parked in the bike lanes on my way to work anymore and I used to encounter five or six a day.

27
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:43,159
Rym: so it might have finally started to work because Because suddenly like there aren't people parked in the bike lane anymore and I'm gonna see if this continues and because I have a log of every time I complain about one and because I log my commutes every day when I bike I can actually like do a regression analysis down the road and figure out if I had an effect or not or at least if there's a correlation between me doing this and People not blocking the bike lane anymore.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,919
Rym: but The other interesting thing is the people who notice me like taking down their license plate number Even if I try to be surreptitious tend to get really mad and yell at me.

29
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:56,680
Rym: But then they also get out of the bike lane because they're actually afraid of the cops coming.

30
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:58,659
Rym: So it kind of works.

31
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:06,077
Rym: We'll see if I get shot, but I'm gonna continue doing this and I think I'm doing the work of the gods Got where would be pleased.

32
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,526
Rym: Okay, you got any news.

33
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:09,269
Rym: news day.

34
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:09,691
Rym: It's Thursday.

35
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:10,072
Rym: It's the lounge.

36
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:10,815
Rym: You can talk about anything.

37
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,100
Scott: Sure Nintendo announced.

38
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:12,907
Rym: Oh, so you agree.

39
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:13,553
Rym: It's the lounge.

40
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:17,992
Rym: No Still low energy and ill.

41
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:22,031
Scott: the Nintendo announced they're making that tiny NES.

42
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,397
Scott: It has like 30 games in it.

43
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,432
Rym: Oh, yeah I didn't even look at what 30 games are in it.

44
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,747
Scott: Uh It's pretty good selection.

45
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,214
Scott: It's like Mario 1 2 3 Zelda 1 2 Metroid.

46
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:40,068
Scott: You know, well, you know, that's like the opposite Castlevania Castlevania 1 2 Contra, you know, it's like Real games like the core set.

47
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:40,570
Scott: I don't know.

48
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,620
Scott: I remember I don't remember if Kirby's Adventure was on there.

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,068
Scott: I think it is better be.

50
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:46,260
Scott: it's pretty much top 30 NES games.

51
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,554
Scott: There's some in there that are like like they have Gradius but they didn't have.

52
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:50,780
Scott: a. life force is like life.

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,665
Rym: Yeah, it's fine.

54
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,134
Rym: Of course wasn't actually that good.

55
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,120
Scott: What are you talking about?

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,742
Rym: I do not enjoy.

57
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,808
Scott: life force is like way better than Gradius.

58
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,835
Scott: I don't know what's wrong with you.

59
00:03:58,915 --> 00:03:59,236
Scott: Actually.

60
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:07,644
Scott: Sorry salamander With also the best Famicom cartridge there is if you've ever seen the cartridge It's the best one.

61
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:13,759
Scott: Anyway, I mean clearly there's some games that are left out But it's like you could have made a much worse selection than this.

62
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,514
Scott: So the thing caught is gonna be out in November for holiday season.

63
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,140
Scott: it's gonna sell out everywhere.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,880
Scott: You're not gonna be able to get one and the price is gonna be way high on eBay.

65
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,219
Scott: So I'm gonna get as many as I can at retail price.

66
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:33,912
Scott: Also, they're selling the controller by itself for 10 bucks and it appears that The controller can plug into the bottom of a Wiimote.

67
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,760
Scott: Is that kind of plug?

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,460
Scott: USB man, so You could just buy the controller by itself for 10 bucks for use with your Wii virtual console.

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,365
Rym: I don't have a Wii I do.

70
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,232
Scott: Okay, or you know, I'm sure people will be.

71
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:51,120
Scott: it's still a brand newly manufactured NES controller.

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,920
Scott: I'm sure people will be making adapters or cutting the cable and making it USB or who knows what right anyway.

73
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:03,107
Scott: but yeah, the thing is I don't need who needs one of these.

74
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:06,380
Rym: I've bought all those games so many times in my life.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,009
Scott: I have all those games emulated.

76
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,336
Rym: you have all those games on card.

77
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:09,497
Rym: like.

78
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,784
Rym: if you buy Like.

79
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:14,023
Scott: if you buy one of these to use it's like wow Talk about like.

80
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:20,350
Scott: the more he's complaining of people who like have extra boxes under their TV because they refused to go with the HD PC, but it's like.

81
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,960
Scott: this is like the most egregious.

82
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:26,780
Scott: You have a box under your TV just for these 30 NES games, even though it's a tiny box.

83
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,507
Scott: Are you fucking kidding me?

84
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:29,792
Rym: and you're gonna pay like 70 bucks for this?

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,669
Rym: Oh my god, you know what I would use it for if I ran a low-rent convention In the video game room.

86
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,080
Rym: I just put like 10 of these in a row.

87
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,680
Scott: Yes, that is a good see that's a use for it right because it doesn't like one tiny crate.

88
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,735
Scott: It is cheaper than an HD PC.

89
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:52,520
Scott: So if all you need it for is those games and you want to say make like any as game station or you know.

90
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:56,836
Scott: Then it like it has purpose but also useful to buy it for your house.

91
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:04,599
Rym: Okay use Use this like for example Say you own a bar in a hip part of a town like New York.

92
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,926
Scott: Sure You put it.

93
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,380
Rym: just you put it there and let people just play it like that's great.

94
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,220
Rym: And then you know every few months one gets smashed and whatever you bought like a hundred of them.

95
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:26,278
Rym: Yeah, or if you're the kind of person who still knows what Nintendo is and has played NES games and enjoys them but simultaneously Don't know how to make emulators go like you're just one of those people who doesn't know things you could be.

96
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:26,820
Scott: it's not hard.

97
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,046
Scott: You could become smarter.

98
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:35,959
Rym: Yeah, I mean not to disparage people but NES and SNES emulation is the easiest thing.

99
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,887
Scott: you Thought you were gonna be giving an excuse for those Mara.

100
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:43,660
Rym: No, no, we solved NES emulation when I was still in high school.

101
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:49,679
Scott: It's like the easiest like it just works like I'll get every game and not 30 games.

102
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:55,300
Rym: Yep I mean, I guess the only hardest part is you have to know how to download an emulator without getting a virus.

103
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:57,300
Rym: Oh my god, which is actually really hard.

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,810
Rym: if you're one of those kinds of people maybe tell ask as some random schmuck to download putty and Even odds and I'm downloading a virus instead of putty.

105
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,500
Scott: putty is a unique condition situation.

106
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,714
Rym: Well, yeah, cuz it's not a weird website that even I every time I download putty.

107
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,160
Rym: I'm like, is that really it, right?

108
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:18,011
Rym: I mean, I do trust it but only because I have noses.

109
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,660
Rym: the anagogic schools would not understand.

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,406
Rym: So, uh, I don't know.

111
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:26,640
Rym: I think that thing is it's cool but stuff like that comes out periodically.

112
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,789
Rym: It's just the best Iteration of that kind of thing and it's the most legit one.

113
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:31,652
Rym: I've like ever seen.

114
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:34,000
Scott: Yeah, but the commercial is pretty good for it.

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,326
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's old style.

116
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:38,522
Scott: It looks like an old Nintendo commercial for you know, us Nintendo You know what?

117
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,780
Rym: I would love to see that Nintendo would probably never announce.

118
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:51,560
Rym: I'd love to know the actual like for real sales numbers of that thing because just knowing that You'll find out I don't know Nintendo's weird and cagey about their actual sales numbers.

119
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,640
Scott: No, you can find out how many game how many copies of games have sold?

120
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,690
Rym: But how many copies of that thing?

121
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,439
Rym: I don't know if it'll be easy to figure that out.

122
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,124
Scott: No It'll be published.

123
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:00,627
Scott: think we will.

124
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,420
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna say, you know, how many wheeze were sold and how many you know?

125
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,308
Scott: Everyone knows all this stuff.

126
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:11,714
Rym: There's debate as to how Company, ah, that doesn't necessarily mean all those things get published you'd expect.

127
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:16,320
Scott: and there's the video game research whatever You know, they that tracks everything so they might try to figure it out.

128
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,400
Scott: No, I'm saying some someone will pay for the report from the ADAR whatever it is and then some write an article about it.

129
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:26,958
Rym: I'll put it this way if it sells a lot That is it's gonna sell out.

130
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:28,911
Scott: Yeah, how many are they gonna make?

131
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:29,940
Scott: it's gonna sell out?

132
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,794
Scott: It'll be the holiday toy that everyone will buy a million of and they'll be.

133
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:33,678
Scott: you won't be able to get it.

134
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,562
Scott: when you go To this we'll see.

135
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:39,058
Rym: I'm gonna put a Google reminder for six months from now to check on what happened with this thing.

136
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,488
Scott: It'll be the well, it comes out in November.

137
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,553
Scott: So it'll be.

Rym: I'll go I'll go try the nice shirt on in person.

150
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,139
Scott: I wouldn't buy other people do.

151
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,279
Scott: But I would not buy a bicycle online.

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:39,040
Rym: I did but I had it delivered to a bike shop to put together for me and I test-rode a very similar model before.

153
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:43,380
Scott: Yeah, but people buy bikes and more bike parts delivered to them and put them together.

154
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,651
Scott: I put together a computer.

155
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,340
Rym: there was a time I would do that in my life.

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,100
Rym: You know when that time ended when I started using carbon fiber, I'm not willing to put together carbon fiber shit.

157
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,615
Scott: I would buy a car online if I was gonna buy a car.

158
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:57,860
Rym: I would definitely buy a car online.

159
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,831
Rym: There's no even a reason to test drive a car anymore.

160
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:00,635
Scott: It's a car.

161
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:01,158
Scott: It's gonna work.

162
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,364
Rym: Yep Just do it.

163
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:03,670
Rym: What what features do you want?

164
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,012
Rym: And how much?

165
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,660
Rym: how many dollars do you want to give up for that car?

166
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:08,580
Rym: But yeah, so basically Amazon.

167
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:10,606
Rym: One thing that I've done.

168
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:14,794
Rym: I'm wearing them right now because I just got home from biking to work And also I figured out why I felt like such shit.

169
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,239
Rym: when I got home I had a notification in my inbox.

170
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:27,860
Rym: Not only is it a heat advisory like danger warning out like you might die in New York City like the health problems But the air quality index is like a hundred and thirty right now.

171
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:33,100
Rym: So like it's basically just like a soup of poison outside and it's super hot.

172
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:56,339
Rym: So I'm wearing some bike shorts now because I commute I wear bike shorts every day and I wash it like I. so I wanted a bunch of pears so I don't have to do bike short laundry like every two days and I didn't want to wear more than once because bike shorts start to smell and while I have some nice like real bike butt stuff I don't want to wear those every time I go to work.

173
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:09,834
Rym: so when I went on Amazon and I found a really nice bike short that did what I wanted it had the the butt pads and everything integrated into it and It was like 10 bucks and I was like really 10 bucks.

174
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,520
Scott: that seems like a knockoff.

175
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,656
Scott: That's gonna disintegrate and hurt and not fit well, so I bought one cuz.

176
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:18,872
Rym: I was like wow That's a $10 lottery ticket like sure and I put him on.

177
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:26,459
Rym: and they're not the best bike shorts in the world But they're fine for biking under like a hundred miles over the course of a day.

178
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,508
Scott: Did they disintegrate in the washing machine?

179
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:29,712
Rym: Nope, so they.

180
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:30,797
Rym: I washed them a bunch of times.

181
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:31,480
Rym: They were just great.

182
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:36,660
Rym: So I bought like eight more pair Mm-hmm, and I just haven't piled up and Emily and I can wear them both.

183
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,939
Rym: So we just share them and they're just like I'd wear these things and they're great.

184
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:41,936
Rym: They are totally like Chinese bootleg.

185
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:56,120
Rym: bullshit Like this is the kind of thing where some company clearly makes like quote-unquote real branded bike shorts by day for some company And then at night they just illegally make a whole bunch more and sell them illegitimately on places like Amazon.

186
00:11:56,989 --> 00:12:11,380
Rym: Now as a consumer This is great because I just basically got a really well constructed product for almost no money when I would have to pay like 80 bucks to get this thing legit from the company that actually Sells the quote-unquote official version of it, right?

187
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,480
Scott: Cuz you only have to pay for the manufacturing and shipping.

188
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,607
Scott: You don't have to pay for the designing and the marketing.

189
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:18,578
Rym: that and the manufacturing is pretty much the same as the real thing.

190
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:26,800
Rym: Yeah So on the other hand, I'm looking up In fact, I just picked up my hand to a battery a couple of different batteries that I've bought.

191
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:35,009
Rym: So wasabi batteries, this is a legitimate Panasonic battery All right That's safe that I paid a hundred and ten.

192
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,428
Scott: there are bootleg batteries that are Somewhat difficult to tell apart from legit ones.

193
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,640
Scott: Yeah that will actually say like Sony or Panasonic on them.

194
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,530
Scott: But this guy's online for you how to tell they're fake.

195
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:47,477
Rym: Yeah, so this battery goes like 110 bucks.

196
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,706
Rym: I also bought a bunch of wasabi batteries.

197
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:51,829
Scott: Wasabi is legit.

198
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,112
Rym: They're they're.

199
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:54,536
Rym: they're mostly legit.

200
00:12:54,777 --> 00:13:00,633
Rym: their batteries have Let's say wide ranges of actual operating voltages.

201
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,600
Scott: I have never had a problem with the wasabi battery.

202
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,114
Rym: I have had many problems with wasabi batteries.

203
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:06,200
Rym: hardly news to me.

204
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,005
Rym: So my camera worked with.

205
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:12,680
Rym: wasabi battery is great and the wasabi batteries lasted like twice as long as the official battery.

206
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:19,115
Rym: Well, like 80 50 to 70 percent longer Let's say not actually double double but they're significantly longer.

207
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,220
Rym: They held a much bigger charge.

208
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:21,043
Rym: They didn't lie.

209
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,527
Rym: They even said they held a bigger charge.

210
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,871
Rym: Yeah, no, it's more dangerous.

211
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:30,472
Rym: Yeah, but after like two months Suddenly the camera would be like oh shit voltage warning and shut down.

212
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:41,280
Rym: Oh and that happened to me with Every wasabi battery I ever bought within six months of purchase failed in that manner except one and I still use that one.

213
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,332
Rym: So wasabi is also hit or miss.

214
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:46,729
Scott: but if you have to write my camera I have one legit and two wasabi batteries.

215
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,115
Scott: They all work perfectly.

216
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,160
Scott: They've always worked perfectly.

217
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:56,409
Rym: I think a difference is that this is an old camcorder and actually draws a lot of power Like way more than you'd expect and I think it has.

218
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:00,456
Rym: it has like tighter tolerances for what it can deal with in terms of the battery.

219
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,491
Rym: This is but this is only a twenty six hundred million.

220
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,478
Scott: I've also used wasabi batteries in my GoPro.

221
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,100
Scott: never had a problem.

222
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:14,379
Rym: Oh, yeah, and the GoPro the GoPro wasabi batteries work fine But the wasabi batteries for my like big camcorder and not great.

223
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:20,600
Rym: But bootleg batteries are this other ballgame because the legit batteries are real expensive.

224
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:25,060
Rym: The next tier down are the batteries that are not counterfeits.

225
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:33,411
Rym: They just happen to have the same form factor like they'll work with the official thing But they're not the official thing and they don't even pretend they're the official thing.

226
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,880
Rym: They're like, yeah, this is a Sorni battery.

227
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:37,725
Rym: Good luck have fun.

228
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:41,460
Rym: not for not even gonna lie to you dude that we made this in a factory.

229
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:43,599
Rym: It'll give you seven ish vaults go nuts.

230
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:45,858
Rym: At least those don't lie to you.

231
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:53,572
Rym: The most dangerous batteries are the ones that say they're the official battery But they're not because that shit is just like we are counterfeiting stuff.

232
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:53,753
Rym: Like.

233
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,940
Rym: there's probably just like a bag of sand in there.

234
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,095
Rym: It's like up some battery acid, but no actual battery.

235
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:01,360
Rym: It's just a rock.

236
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:15,142
Rym: But the point is Amazon has pretty much Every bootleg thing in the world is in there and it's often real hard to figure out if a listing is a legitimate thing or a Bootleg.

237
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:15,905
Scott: take the reviews.

238
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,195
Rym: Yeah, but it's high.

239
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:23,980
Rym: with technical things The reviews always work because there's always people who are like they know their shit and they're like.

240
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:28,435
Rym: This is clearly a bootleg shuttle pro because the real shuttle pro is this extra button.

241
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:29,198
Rym: blah blah blah.

242
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:34,760
Scott: one time I was buying a Lenovo laptop battery on Amazon and I thought it might be bootleg cuz it was so cheap.

243
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,460
Scott: So I messaged Amazon and I said is this real and they said if it's not real we'll refund you and I got it.

244
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,967
Scott: It was real.

245
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:47,413
Rym: so Birkenstock Decided that they make hippie sandals.

246
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:48,720
Rym: did they make the best sandals though?

247
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,017
Rym: Like they're not gonna lie like this might date us as being a little bit old and white But they're pretty much the best sandals in the world.

248
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,053
Rym: Like I Wear them they're okay.

249
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:05,933
Rym: They're hippie sandals Yeah But they're just real comfortable and also they are one of the few sandal people who have the three strap sandal fuck.

250
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:15,500
Rym: the two strap or the one strap and Toe holes are the worst possible sandal, but Birkenstock and all those subsidiaries were like Amazon.

251
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:20,554
Rym: Nothing, nothing we make will ever be legitimate on Amazon.

252
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,018
Rym: We refuse new business with Amazon.

253
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:27,820
Rym: Amazon doesn't care Yeah, so if you ever see a Birkenstock thing on Amazon, it is definitely a bootleg.

254
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,317
Scott: So it's probably just as good and looks the same and cost less.

255
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,159
Scott: Yep So all they're doing is not as losing their own sales.

256
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:39,720
Scott: Well, the problem is I only buy shoes on Zappos, which is also Amazon.

257
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,735
Scott: So then you take this stuff off Zappos also, I don't think so, but Zappos.

258
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,080
Scott: Zappos doesn't sell bootlegs.

259
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,560
Scott: You don't can't list your stuff on Zappos, but Zappos is the only place that go to buy shoes.

260
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,463
Rym: Well, see that's the thing.

261
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:56,520
Rym: I only buy shoes on Zappos because Zappos is Amazon while I don't care, but it's not.

262
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:00,806
Rym: but it is Birkenstock, yeah, it's all there.

263
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:01,389
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,808
Rym: But the thing is on Zappos They're pretty expensive and they're good sandals.

265
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,619
Scott: Well, Zappos is never a discount place like Amazon.

266
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,460
Scott: Yeah, Zappos is just excellent customer service normal price.

267
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,474
Rym: It's like going to B&H to buy like some video equipment like.

268
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:16,540
Rym: yeah, it's expensive.

269
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,119
Rym: But there's someone there who actually knows it's not expensive it's just normal price.

270
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,079
Rym: Yeah, but normal price is expensive in the modern world of ZRAI, see through anything.

271
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:33,140
Rym: So Basically, what the problem Birkenstock saw was that no one ever bought the legit sandals on Amazon.

272
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,248
Rym: So taking them off Amazon doesn't actually hurt them.

273
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:38,600
Rym: People only bought the bootlegs because the bootlegs were like 20 bucks.

274
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,959
Scott: You're not gonna make Amazon stop selling the bootlegs, though.

275
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:44,754
Rym: so they've tried because it is illegal for Amazon to continue to sell to like.

276
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:53,760
Rym: let them sell these things and Amazon basically just doesn't enter like doesn't do it Like doesn't deal with it doesn't respond and kind of just lets the marketplace be the Wild West.

277
00:17:54,663 --> 00:18:00,385
Rym: As far as I can tell this wasn't a huge problem until relatively recently When Amazon changed its rules.

278
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:03,433
Scott: I feel like there's been bootleg stuff on Amazon for a long time.

279
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:14,007
Rym: There was but it got way worse When they changed their rules and allowed Chinese manufacturers to sell goods directly on Amazon Which was not allowed before.

280
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:14,670
Scott: so what were they?

281
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,634
Scott: how were they doing it before?

282
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,060
Rym: they had before their shell companies?

283
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,100
Rym: At least have a shell company or an importer or someone like laundering the counterfeit goods.

284
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:26,320
Rym: But now like the company that makes the bootlegs can just straight-up sell the bootlegs.

285
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,208
Scott: So you don't need your art vandal a anymore.

286
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:28,810
Rym: No more.

287
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,894
Rym: I importer exporter.

288
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,914
Rym: So if you want to buy chips legitimate chips.

289
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:36,507
Rym: So I don't really have a moral here.

290
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:36,809
Rym: It's just.

291
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:45,850
Rym: this is a very interesting problem because on one hand if if you buy a Bootleg, that's just a night run from a factory.

292
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,680
Rym: It is literally as good as the official version.

293
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:54,140
Rym: You're basically just stealing from the company that paid to do all the research and design and marketing.

294
00:18:55,081 --> 00:19:03,809
Rym: But if you buy a bootleg that is on like a knockoff in the sense of someone just copied someone else's design Independently and sells a shitty version of it.

295
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,880
Rym: You're basically paying less for a shit-tier version, right?

296
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,307
Scott: It's like I'm fine buying something.

297
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,740
Scott: That's just as good as the original like a wasabi battery.

298
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,780
Scott: I just don't want to buy a bootleg if it's not gonna work.

299
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:20,440
Scott: for example I recently Bought this thing that plugs into the bottom of the iPad and lets you connect an SD card to get the photos onto the iPad.

300
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:22,792
Rym: Oh, my phone just takes SD cards.

301
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,433
Rym: a full-size ones Well mini ones I can put the 64 gig one in there.

302
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:36,167
Scott: You can have anyway, so 64 gig just hanging out so I can load raw photos into Lightroom mobile Anyway, which they just added as a feature.

303
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,713
Rym: So I did not notice that.

304
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:38,075
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:44,312
Scott: Anyway the Apple sells one of these things for a bunch of money and I went.

306
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:46,340
Scott: I'm like, well, here's the price of the Apple store.

307
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:50,440
Scott: I could stop and get one at the Apple store on the way home But let's see how much they are in Amazon.

308
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,770
Scott: So I find that an Amazon and then I read the comments and the comments are like, uh, this is not legit product This is a Chinese thing that didn't even work.

309
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:04,920
Scott: and I'm like, oh well if it doesn't work I'll buy the legit one that's overpriced right, but if that one worked I don't care if it's Chinese as long as it works.

310
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,999
Scott: Yeah, sometimes it doesn't work.

311
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:16,940
Rym: I guess that the real danger I see is that in the race to the bottom of you know Most people just buy the cheapest version of anything and we do know what one of the end games of that is.

312
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,478
Rym: You've seen how airplanes are.

313
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:26,880
Rym: Economy is nightmare mode if you're flying overseas and anything better costs an order of magnitude more money and nothing in between.

314
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:35,300
Scott: Right, but if the price difference there is too big I can't afford the quality that I want Yeah, whereas here it's like if I can afford the level of quality that I want.

315
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:43,560
Rym: But the knockoffs especially with technology are often dangerous or like broken in some way that a normal person wouldn't understand.

316
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:44,448
Scott: Yeah, that's no good.

317
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:53,663
Rym: But the bike shorts you got were fine Yeah, but at the same time I went into the bike shorts knowing one like I knew a hundred percent that this might be some bullshit Mm-hmm.

318
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:58,160
Rym: I don't think most people buying the cheapest battery on Amazon know that it might be some bullshit.

319
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,269
Rym: I think they see the Sorni battery and they're like looks legit.

320
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,811
Scott: Hmm.

321
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,900
Rym: It's just all an interesting thing that there's no good answers.

322
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:13,893
Rym: I mean globalization and all these issues are just culminating into an Unanswerable question that no nation is willing to deal with and everyone has complexity.

323
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:17,024
Scott: companies want to benefit from free trade having their stuff Made in China.

324
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,078
Scott: Well, then it's not just companies that should be benefiting from the free trade.

325
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:22,494
Scott: individual People should be benefiting the same way as well.

326
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:28,898
Scott: Yeah If you don't want the free trade then either everyone has the free trade or no one has the free trade.

327
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:29,340
Scott: That's the choice.

328
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,247
Scott: It's got to be equal.

329
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,840
Scott: You can't be like up companies.

330
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:37,671
Scott: If you have a company you could buy stuff from China for free But if you're an individual person, no, we can't let no fuck you.

331
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:37,751
Scott: Yep.

332
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:42,886
Rym: That's why I'm very much kind of for Decreasing free trade.

333
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:43,087
Rym: right?

334
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,340
Scott: all the people who complain about globalization, right?

335
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,466
Scott: It's like there's like, you know, they're complaining, you know that they want to end it right there against it But it's like no really I'm.

336
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:56,340
Scott: I'm for it as long as I can benefit from it individually as well.

337
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,740
Scott: Right, then the problem goes away.

338
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,140
Rym: As long as it It is the tide that rises with all the ships in the harbor.

339
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:12,823
Rym: It can't be like there's one giant Megacorp ship sitting in a lock and it goes up and down and everyone else is just dried out on the beach Exactly.

340
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,800
Scott: Well splooshed by the waves and in the wake of the giant shit.

341
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,819
Rym: Yeah, my metaphor is already breaking down, but you know what I mean?

342
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,219
Rym: But yeah.

343
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:24,200
Rym: Anyway, the only other news a lot it is interesting.

344
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,259
Rym: How many of you were like texting me and messaging me when this was going on?

345
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:36,300
Rym: because I literally went into the subway to go on a trip, but yeah turkey had a coup and All my friends are safe except for a few friends who they're safe.

346
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:44,140
Rym: But I realized in retrospect like four days before the coup I have a couple of people I know who basically were like yo dog.

347
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,969
Rym: So here's my resume.

348
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,339
Rym: just in case anything pinky happens If you ever need someone who speaks Turkish and knows tech I might be moving to the states real soon.

349
00:22:53,843 --> 00:22:55,757
Scott: Yeah, you got a h1b or green card.

350
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:56,120
Scott: Good luck.

351
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:57,645
Rym: Actually, most of them went to Canada.

352
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:11,077
Rym: Canada is like where anyone who was smart who had money in Turkey and is young and at a text like tech skills They if even if they didn't GTFO They got visas to go to Canada for long periods of time in Canada way colder than Turkey.

353
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:16,700
Rym: Uh Turkey's actually pretty temperate Turkey lays like a little bit warmer than New York.

354
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:25,939
Scott: I mean it has mountains where it snows but I can't imagine it's snowing on like the Mediterranean coast Turkey is Surprisingly similar to like a Great Lakes climate in a lot of ways.

355
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:32,880
Rym: There's lake effect snow from the Mediterranean in terms of like the water around especially Istanbul in that part of Turkey.

356
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,525
Rym: I mean, obviously Turkey's huge.

357
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:37,916
Rym: I got snow plows and parts of Turkey are by Syria.

358
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:39,100
Scott: They play ice hockey somewhere.

359
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,823
Scott: There's not the mountain.

360
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:40,084
Scott: now.

361
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,634
Rym: take it like everything and shift it one step warmer.

362
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,140
Rym: But otherwise, there's a similar vibe.

363
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:51,020
Scott: And again, that's just all I'm saying if you leave Turkey to go to Canada We should invest in coats.

364
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:55,676
Rym: Well, most of them that I know at least they actually went to Vancouver which has really warm.

365
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:56,780
Scott: So Vancouver is fine.

366
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,420
Rym: Yeah, I mean winters are death there.

367
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,224
Rym: That's the least.

368
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:03,868
Rym: the least cold part of and also one of the words It's it's the winner is awful.

369
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:06,158
Rym: But the Sunshine Coast is called the Sunshine Coast.

370
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:13,696
Rym: words Things of the day.

371
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:14,619
Scott: What was my thing?

372
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,141
Rym: Okay.

373
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:16,806
Rym: So this is a YouTube series.

374
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:17,850
Rym: It's only six episodes.

375
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,678
Rym: It's short and a super high production values.

376
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:31,610
Rym: so you can each episode is like three minutes long, but it's basically Sesame Street like puppets and teaching kids about creativity and imagination and all these things.

377
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,076
Rym: but Remember that video that video.

378
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:36,522
Rym: we use this thing a day a long time ago.

379
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,470
Rym: the let's all go.

380
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:38,992
Rym: It's the.

381
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:45,890
Rym: it's like the pre-roll to a drive-in theater like go get your snacks before the movie starts Yeah, and then it slowly gets sinister and then it gets creepy.

382
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,215
Rym: The show is happy three friends.

383
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:49,238
Rym: This is like that.

384
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,502
Rym: Don't hug me.

385
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:51,686
Rym: I'm scared.

386
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,030
Rym: It's kind of disturbing.

387
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,017
Scott: Really well done.

388
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:03,921
Rym: and those of you who listen to the weird stuff I put at the end of the episode for the patrons and the patreon This is where I've been getting the clips from for the past week.

389
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,110
Scott: This is your internet weird kind of shit.

390
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,993
Rym: It's really good though.

391
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:12,330
Rym: Like this would not be out of place in a film festival or on television late at night.

392
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,015
Rym: A Warning like for real.

393
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:18,802
Rym: the music in it'll get really badly stuck in your head.

394
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:19,484
Rym: Hmm.

395
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:28,592
Scott: So the Sega Saturn one of the Somewhat forgotten but also awesome and important gaming consoles of history It's it's.

396
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:34,910
Rym: it's why it's a very important console and it had some legendary games some very legendary game Yeah, anyway.

397
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:49,413
Scott: So the Sega Saturn has been a problem for a long time because it uses a disk drive optical ness and the problem is that those disk drives are Wearing out you.

398
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:54,529
Scott: if you buy a Sega Saturn, it's kind of not easiest to find one with like a working CD-ROM drive.

399
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:03,042
Scott: And also there was a DRM system for those CD-ROM drives that was actually rather fancy and hard to get around.

400
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:15,663
Scott: it had like they made custom CDs that had like a Like a wavy line drawn on the in like on the first ring of the the bottom And it's like you can't make your CD-ROM burn that.

401
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:19,526
Scott: so if you want to burn a disc and put it into a Saturn You basically can't.

402
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,074
Scott: Alright.

403
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:30,809
Scott: so the Sega Saturn also on the inside of it The hardware was really complex like it has two CPUs and it has a separate CPU just for the CD-ROM.

404
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,361
Scott: It's like it's a really complex kind of hardware.

405
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:40,189
Scott: It's all you know, it's like an arcade hardware, basically It's sort of a miracle that people made games for this thing.

406
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:51,569
Scott: So some guy he had this project where he was gonna figure out how that CD-ROM actually fucking worked and how that whole system worked so that he could basically rescue the Sega Saturn.

407
00:26:51,589 --> 00:27:06,738
Scott: and He basically went above and beyond the Call of Duty and managed to create a like a board That you could put in the expansion slot in the back and then just like forget about your CD-ROM Just load games through the back.

408
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,346
Scott: All right, no problem.

409
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:20,487
Scott: So He made a video like explaining everything and if you don't know enough about computers You might not understand everything he's talking about, but maybe even then you'll still learn something about computers.

410
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:30,818
Scott: All right D I'm just looking at all these Sega Saturn games and you'll learn something really fascinating about the Sega Saturn and CD-ROMs and Gaming and cool stuff.

411
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:33,006
Rym: So this is way beyond the like.

412
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,278
Rym: even in mod ship I soldered into my PlayStation.

413
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:38,976
Scott: even if you're never gonna use this or Play me Sega Saturn games though.

414
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:39,458
Scott: You should.

415
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:42,510
Scott: you can learn a lot of awesome stuff from this guy's video.

416
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,330
Scott: He's like a mad genius of us, you know hardwares and whatnot.

417
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:52,970
Scott: So I'm looking forward to maybe this developing further so that I could play some of those long-lost Saturn games.

418
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,159
Scott: Well, they're not long-lost, but you know, I've never been able to play the man wave Crime wave.

419
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,610
Scott: there's that one Japanese one.

420
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:07,258
Scott: That's like the boat that's supposed to be like the best game ever, but no one's ever no one in the US can play it Even just to play something like that.

421
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:14,038
Scott: fighting game was I think was called like fighters megamix they had like The robot and the police girl and whatever.

422
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:18,130
Scott: and then you know, there are a lot of Saturn even just playing Saturn Bomberman.

423
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:19,105
Scott: It's like come on.

424
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,075
Rym: Yeah I mean the Sega Saturn's.

425
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:24,630
Rym: not like emulators for it or not great as far as I can tell either.

426
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,186
Scott: Well, the emulator people have learned from the things this guy learned to greatly improve their emulator.

427
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:30,210
Rym: Oh that actually makes sense.

428
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:34,507
Scott: So it makes a lot of sense at least the part of the emulator that cares about CD roms.

429
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:44,877
Rym: in the moment We are going to be live at PAX West 2016 the grind on Saturday September 3rd at 5 p.m In the chicken theater.

430
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:51,139
Scott: I actually bought two tickets to fax for West Prime Don't Rome and I now don't need Rome.

431
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,226
Rym: I okay good cuz she got caught up.

432
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:57,089
Rym: She was accused of being a Scalper really by the coup system.

433
00:28:57,332 --> 00:29:03,866
Rym: I don't know if she lost her badges or not But but there are many reports of people who got badges taken away who were not scalping.

434
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:04,990
Scott: They got some false positives.

435
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,672
Scott: It's not good.

436
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:09,042
Rym: Yeah, cuz she I would like I know our friends.

437
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:11,890
Rym: No one we know is ever scalped a PAX badge.

438
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,387
Scott: Yeah, well, I wonder what they did that triggered it.

439
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:23,417
Rym: So the way I from what I can gather it was because two different sets of badges ended up getting delivered to the same street address And that was enough to flag it.

440
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:26,010
Scott: Oh Jeremy also bought badges separately something like that.

441
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:41,870
Rym: I don't know the full story, but that that was the most common theme was like roommates in a house mostly like college students were like four of them would all buy four badges each separately But they all lived in the same like a street address and that was the kind of thing that triggered it.

442
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:44,397
Rym: Mmm, anyway, we'll see.

443
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,594
Rym: if she if our friends don't need him then yeah What are you lucky?

444
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,181
Rym: people might be able to get them?

445
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:51,290
Scott: Yeah, cuz I could use the money they cost.

446
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,158
Rym: This is our 40th packs panel.

447
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,006
Rym: We've never paid for a packs.

448
00:29:55,026 --> 00:30:03,227
Rym: we go where every year They invite us back to every packs to do panels and yet every year I'm so paranoid and terrified that they won't bring us back for some really surprise man.

449
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:10,567
Rym: Yeah I'm not worried about any other keg now like if they didn't invite us to PAX South I practice wouldn't go or paxies like I but PAX Prime I would go to.

450
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,075
Scott: Well PAX South I can just buy a ticket if they don't accept our panel, but paxies Enforcing.

451
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:19,837
Rym: Yeah, so we can go if we want to but Australia.

452
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:21,309
Rym: we pretty much told us we could do a panel.

453
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,696
Rym: We just got to decide if we're going to.

454
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:23,661
Rym: you want to go.

455
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:25,429
Rym: we got patreon money and go somewhere else.

456
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,573
Rym: We're gonna go.

457
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:28,966
Rym: we could save that patreon money and do a nice with the palm tree.

458
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:30,552
Rym: want to do an Essen Extravaganza.

00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,441
Scott: with the picture we're going to Essen in 2018.

00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,184
Scott: I guess this year.

00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:34,370
Scott: I wanna go someplace with palm trees.

462
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:35,969

Scott: No hundred bucks round trip.

466
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:43,630
Rym: It's boring.

467
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:45,775
Rym: Go to I don't know Singapore.

468
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:47,441
Scott: That's not the nicest place.

469
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:48,525
Rym: Hong Kong is super nice.

470
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,030
Scott: It's now size problems.

00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:52,883
Rym: what problems would you have in Hong Kong?

473
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:53,486
Scott: None?

474
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:53,868
Scott: Probably?

475
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,596
Rym: Yeah It's problems do not affect us.

476
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:59,550
Rym: we're not booksellers nor are we agitators for democracy.

477
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:09,359
Rym: in other meta news now if remember how I said that one now that we're back and we're not sick and Kineticons behind us we're gonna start cranking content out.

478
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:14,523
Rym: Scott is gonna be making a shit ton of video this weekend Unless the weather is super good.

479
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:15,310
Scott: Maybe at night.

Rym: So there's 41 comments on it now, and I just uploaded the video like this part or yesterday morning.

483
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,182
Scott: That's not a lot of kind for us.

484
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,148
Rym: That's a lot of comments.

485
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:42,150
Rym: That said that 41 comments are good, dude If we get like 30 or 40 thousand views on a video I consider that pretty good because we're not.

486
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,668
Rym: There's not a wide audience for what we do.

487
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:56,650
Rym: What is the audience of people who want to who not only know what anime is Know what utenna is and want to watch us talk about it for like 40 minutes an episode?

488
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,157
Scott: I hope that audience would be zero.

489
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:01,070
Rym: that audience is five or six thousand at least as far as I can tell.

490
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,129
Scott: That's too much audience.

491
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:07,146
Rym: Yeah So, uh, it's up and we're gonna make a whole bunch more stuff as soon as we can.

503
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:47,880

Rym: So I'll read it this weekend for sure.

514
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,520
Scott: It'll take me six hours, so we had to come up with an alternate show idea.

515
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,877
Rym: Yep, and that alternate show idea is Clothing great cuz we did it.

516
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:14,950
Rym: It was your idea great crab people you got there.

517
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:16,720

Scott: you had a perfect.

519
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:18,570
Scott: we had a perfect show idea.

520
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:19,696
Scott: You know, you didn't do it.

521
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,630
Rym: We could talk about the prince of nothing book about Shinji in his day.

522
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,038
Scott: I only read half of it so far.

523
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,769
Rym: so far half this book is Hey come with me to talk to my dad.

524
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:31,681
Scott: That's only the most recent chapter.

525
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:32,486
Scott: That's half the book.

526
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,541
Rym: there There's another dad.

527
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,973
Rym: Oh Sure.

528
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,730
Rym: Okay, whatever and there's a third day.

529
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,802
Scott: Yeah, there's a bunch of people going to talk to their dad.

530
00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:41,090
Rym: everybody's going to talk to their dad.

531
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,557
Rym: That's that's what's going on all that.

532
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:44,647
Scott: It's all the sons going towards dads.

533
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:48,377
Scott: Yep But daddy issues all over the world.

534
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,363
Rym: We've done shows on shoes.

535
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:52,250
Scott: We've done and literal dads.

536
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,843
Rym: We've done shows on underwear specifically back in 2008.

537
00:33:56,843 --> 00:33:59,250
Rym: We've done shows on a bunch of like oddly specific things.

538
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,157
Rym: We did a show on fire once.

539
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:04,368
Rym: that's what happens when you do like 1,200 shows over the course of 11 years.

540
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:11,510
Rym: But we've never done a show on the concept of clothing our naked bodies and garments of some fashion.

541
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:22,670
Scott: Well, first of all personally other than protection from weather and elements Like I would be perfectly fine going somewhere where clothes were in a thing

542
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:32,097
Rym: I would pretty much like on a day like today if I could get away with it Like if it weren't for the fact that like my office building wouldn't let me in I would not wear shirts like.

543
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,322
Rym: I would just not wear a shirt.

544
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:37,034
Rym: Hmm, but I would wear Something over my genitals.

545
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:43,315
Scott: and but I mean just for protection for the elements like and the thing is like but also to protect the Elements from me.

546
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,101
Rym: it's protection both from and for the elements.

547
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:46,025
Rym: For example, right?

548
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,350
Rym: It's like I don't like to be naked.

549
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:51,949
Rym: I don't want to sit in my office chair naked because now there's butt all over my office chair exactly.

550
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:59,195
Scott: But also It's also like in terms of other people like a lot of people don't want to be naked because they don't want other people to See them like.

551
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:00,440
Scott: oh you've seen me.

552
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,830
Scott: Oh, no, but it's like I don't care if you see me naked.

553
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:08,090
Scott: The thing is you see I'm afraid that you don't want to see me.

554
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:16,850
Scott: So that's you know, that's why I'm like, you know I'll still I won't like just change in the middle of a room of people because pretty sure they don't want to see that.

555
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:18,255
Rym: Yep, so it's interesting.

556
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:24,383
Rym: I've gone through different phases of clothing up like when I was really young like elementary school From what I can remember and like.

557
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,317
Rym: even before elementary school I cared a lot about what like.

558
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:30,350
Rym: I wanted to be fashionable I guess and I cared a lot about what clothes I wore.

559
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:42,599
Rym: But at the same time I was super picky about it And I would just spend forever trying to decide what clothes to buy and my parents would just buy shit for me without my permission Because they didn't want to deal with it.

560
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,830
Rym: and then I just gave up and never cared about clothes again.

561
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:53,821
Scott: My caring about fashion is pretty much I don't want to advertise Something on my body that I don't like so I won't.

562
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:55,066
Rym: that's why I do what you don't wear.

563
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:57,190
Rym: Nazi uniforms good That's a good one.

564
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:08,409
Scott: But like for example, there's a lot of clothing stores you go to like underneath my previous office like a block away from my current office There is a super dry and if you go to super dry, I'm advertising them now, I guess fuck them.

565
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,276
Rym: They make okay stuff.

566
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:18,189
Scott: you look at their stuff and actually I can't deny their clothes are way cool Like I would buy those clothes But they're overpriced of course, but not by that much.

567
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,870
Scott: They all say super dry all over them all over the fucking place.

568
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,114
Scott: It's like dude, if you just took your fucking logos off those clothes I would buy them.

569
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:26,624
Scott: so I end up going to Uniqlo.

570
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:33,050
Scott: because you go to Uniqlo The only place it says on the clothing anything is on the tag on the inside.

571
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,925
Scott: So, you know when you buy a red shirt there, it's a fucking red shirt.

572
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:36,608
Scott: It's just red.

573
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,255
Rym: on one hand I see where you're coming from.

574
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:41,627
Rym: Like when you see a person who's wearing just like a coca-cola shirt.

575
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:42,430
Rym: You're like why?

576
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:49,102
Rym: Exactly, but at the same time I don't care that much and Definitely with height.

577
00:36:49,143 --> 00:36:54,603
Rym: with fashion There is definitely a. the brand itself is part of the fashion.

578
00:36:54,884 --> 00:37:02,861
Scott: whether or not you take that as a pure commercialist Nyla, oh, no, it is the part of the fashion Only fashion decision that I care about.

579
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,793
Rym: the super dry logo that just says super dry I kind of like.

580
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:06,597
Scott: I don't like that.

581
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:07,482
Rym: Like I don't mind it.

582
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:10,218
Scott: I like where it packs logo I'll wear a packs logo.

583
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:13,838
Rym: Well, like right now I'm wearing an Under Armour logo Just because they put their logo on all their shit.

584
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,310
Rym: And that's actually, you know, that's a trend.

585
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,909
Rym: That's that's something that's changed in my life a lot.

586
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:29,730
Rym: I used to wear nerd shirts or dress shirts or like more clothes like that, but as time has gone on I've replaced a lot of the kinds of clothes I used to own with technical sports gear.

587
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:46,430
Rym: Like I threw away every undershirt I owned and the only undershirts I have are various forms of technical or specialist like sports fabric Like either form-fitting or compression or like moisture wicking or those super super thin ones that Uniqlo has.

588
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,230
Scott: I mean, I'll wear stuff in a situation where it's warranted but like but like I'll use them as undershirts.

589
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,637
Scott: How much of that do I really need?

590
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:59,406
Rym: but like if I need an undershirt under like dress clothes I'll wear like a fancy sweat wicking like Under Armour thing.

591
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,510
Scott: I wear a regular undershirt.

592
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:00,851
Scott: What's it?

593
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:01,253
Scott: Why?

594
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:05,930
Rym: Well, cuz then they don't wick the sweat and I get sweaty or they're uncomfortable or I don't have those problems.

595
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:06,713
Rym: I don't know.

596
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:08,078
Rym: I'd prefer to be more comfortable.

597
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,005
Scott: Also those any more comfortable.

598
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,470
Rym: What do you mean by a regular undershirt?

599
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,357
Rym: Do you mean like a cotton undershirt?

600
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:14,361
Scott: Yeah, like a t-shirt.

601
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:14,842
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:16,770
Rym: Why would you ever wear that under a nice shirt?

603
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,312
Scott: Why not?

604
00:38:17,593 --> 00:38:20,002
Rym: because one it creates unpleasant lines.

605
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:23,056
Rym: because the shirt is obviously a nice form-fitted shirt You're ruining the lines.

606
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:23,680
Scott: It doesn't?

607
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,550
Scott: that doesn't seem to happen.

608
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:27,820
Scott: That just means you're doesn't bother me and I don't care.

609
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,769
Rym: that just means you wear two baggy shirts for one.

610
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,930
Rym: Two you don't want the collars show.

611
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:36,911
Rym: The collar helps the undershirt When?

612
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:37,373
Rym: why?

613
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:41,690
Rym: the only time you ever want to collar the show is if you're unbuttoning the upper collar and you want that color accent.

614
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:43,445
Rym: And frankly, I don't like that style.

615
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:46,560
Scott: You can also See, this is the thing you care about all these styles.

616
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,706
Scott: I don't give a shit about styles.

617
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:52,370
Scott: All right, three You could also wear a v-neck t-shirt and then the collar doesn't show.

618
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,842
Rym: Regular cotton undershirts don't wick sweat and that's just uncomfortable.

619
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:58,110
Scott: I don't have sweat unless I do something athletic.

620
00:38:58,391 --> 00:38:59,557
Rym: I'm always doing athletic stuff.

621
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:01,425
Scott: You're running around and you're wearing dress clothes.

622
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:02,350
Rym: I'm walking quickly.

623
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,462
Scott: Hi, you sweat just walking quickly.

624
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:05,568
Rym: I think I walk faster than you.

625
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:07,014
Scott: now I don't I don't.

626
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,842
Scott: I walk pretty fast and I don't.

627
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:11,613
Scott: I don't sweat unless I actually am Exercising.

628
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:15,210
Rym: most important the fancy technical stuff never smells bad no matter how much you sweat.

629
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:18,669
Scott: Yeah My clothes don't smell bad unless I wear them like three or four times.

630
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:23,630
Rym: And and also kind of the side thing the nice clothes like this they move the seams.

631
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,020
Rym: They don't have seams like on the top.

632
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,350
Rym: The seams are all out of the way.

633
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,459
Rym: So they'll never chase and never mess up your lines.

634
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:30,066
Scott: I never had those problems.

635
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:30,990
Rym: Okay, I care about this.

636
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,342
Rym: Also, you don't run like you don't do most active sports.

637
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:35,030
Scott: I'm not running if we're in dress clothes.

638
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:40,590
Scott: Yeah, I have active type things But I don't have a lot of them because I only wear them when it's time to do something active.

639
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,958
Scott: I don't wear them just like every day.

640
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:44,130
Rym: So I do active stuff like I like to work every day.

641
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,777
Rym: So I wear like sports clothes every day.

642
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:47,886
Scott: You're right, but you're underneath dress clothes.

643
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:48,870
Scott: You go to a fancy party.

644
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,349
Scott: You gotta wear sports clothes underneath now.

645
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,194
Rym: So in that case I don't.

646
00:39:51,234 --> 00:40:01,450
Rym: but like when I'm working a convention and I like the staff shirt like the enforcer shirt I wear the Sacrificial undershirt, so I don't get the enforcer shirt sweaty because I only got one of them for three or four days.

647
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:06,070
Scott: I knew I've worn the enforcer shirt for three or four days and it's never been smelly or sweaty.

648
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,721
Scott: I Don't know cuz I'm not a sweaty.

649
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:14,766
Rym: beasts on Sunday We'll give your enforcer shirt and I sniff and see how it smells.

650
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:15,309
Scott: go for it.

651
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:18,086
Rym: All right, the under the enforcer undershirt challenge.

652
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:20,035
Rym: All right All right, fine.

653
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:23,790
Rym: I'll say put it this way Scott independent of us and our magic powers.

654
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:27,230
Rym: Imagine the average person out there normal American.

655
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:31,755
Rym: They need to be wearing Don't smell bad clothes.

656
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:37,274
Scott: They need to if they smell bad stop smelling bad Huh?

657
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,362
Rym: But it's baked in is marinated.

658
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:42,990
Scott: That's fix your body But it's a broken body.

659
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:43,613
Scott: but basically

660
00:40:43,633 --> 00:41:02,950
Rym: the other difference is like when I used to travel like Edward jeans when I flew or I'd wear like pajamas when I flew sometimes like I would just wear something that seemed comfortable as normal clothes changing to wearing like Technical fabrics or like sports clothes like I have some pants that are basically only for like hiking and travel and that kind of stuff.

661
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:09,210
Rym: Holy shit, is that a billion times more comfortable when you're on a flight for 12 hours than wearing like any form of jeans?

662
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,105
Scott: Yeah, I have really comfortable jeans.

663
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:20,689
Rym: They're just like Yeah, but jeans have like bits in the back That'll dig into your butt or waist if you're sitting for 12 hours in a row if you have uncomfortable jeans that have those bits.

664
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:32,750
Scott: Oh, that's the thing is I might not care about styles or lines or whatever the fuck you're paying attention to but comfort and Fitting properly is like, you know, these jeans have a seam near that comes up near the butt.

665
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:37,004
Scott: I've never had any pains associated with any seam on a jean.

666
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,650
Rym: Did you wear jeans flying to Australia?

667
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,794
Scott: I think we're shorts.

668
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,719
Scott: because yeah, okay.

669
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,559
Rym: Okay, but I mean I've Took hold on a plane like that.

670
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:52,283
Rym: I've worn jeans on planes many times Like four or five hours, but most of my flights are like 12 to 25 hours.

671
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,410
Scott: So I mean some jeans are definitely more comfortable than others, right?

672
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,179
Scott: Like there's that huge trend of like selvedge.

673
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,670
Scott: does all these like selvedge denim, which is basically denim.

674
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,074
Scott: That's stiff as a fucking board.

675
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:07,542
Scott: Yeah, and it's like yeah, why would you?

676
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:11,698
Scott: I'm like, oh you break it in never wash It just keep wearing it and never wash it.

677
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:13,890
Scott: and I'm like get out of my face you dirty hippie.

678
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,490
Scott: I used to get some soft jeans that are nice.

679
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:33,101
Rym: I used to wear normal heavy traditional denim jeans and I used to have that sort of disdain For the not just denim jeans, but now all my jeans are like denim rayon denim spandex hybrids Like all my jeans are basically stretch pants that look like jeans.

680
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:35,750
Scott: I just get the soft ones that are comfortable.

681
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,396
Scott: Yeah, don't even pay attention.

682
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:38,841
Rym: I do get the super tight jeans though.

683
00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:44,050
Scott: I mean, yeah, that's the other thing It's like, you know people who care about fashion.

684
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:47,109
Scott: There's always things that are in fashion and out of fashion, right?

685
00:42:47,670 --> 00:43:00,357
Scott: But the truth is if you were to say dress in You know 70s fashion 80s fashion 90s fashion and you pick any decade 1890s fashion, right pick any decade.

686
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:10,401
Scott: take something that's fashionable at that moment that fits you properly and is comfortable And if you wear it today You'll look great, ah, you can.

687
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:12,309
Scott: what was in fashion in the 40s today?

688
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,427
Rym: Large sunglasses huge sideburns.

689
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:19,324
Scott: sure I see people walking on the street like that occasionally.

690
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:23,570
Scott: as long as you do it You know, it's like if they would have looked great then they look great now.

691
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:31,270
Scott: But obviously you can do any fashion Poorly if you think where things that don't fit or don't match or well don't match is the most important one the people who?

692
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:33,306
Rym: Add a trilby or fedora.

693
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:35,798
Scott: you can go Just unmatched clothes.

694
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:49,050
Scott: You can buy 2010s fashion the latest trends and get something It doesn't fit you and doesn't match and you'll look hideous and you can get something that's so out of style for the 90s You know, but totally fits you and totally matches and you could look great in it.

695
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,209
Scott: It's you know, it's like you don't got to pay attention to what the trends are.

696
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:55,748
Scott: You just have to get something that is good no matter when.

697
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:55,989
Scott: yep.

698
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:11,716
Rym: One trouble I've had those that my typical feel like the clothes I typically wear if I'm not doing sports and I'm not like dressing nicely for some reason is either board shorts and a Hawaiian shirt or Jeans and a nerd shirt.

699
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,750
Scott: now where jeans in a nerd shirt or shorts in a nerd shirt or shorts.

700
00:44:15,931 --> 00:44:17,705
Rym: I don't wear shorts in a nerd shirt that much anymore.

701
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:22,228
Rym: if I wear shorts I pretty much always wear Hawaiian shirt just because that way I can unbutton it.

702
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:28,867
Scott: I'll wear a shirt like this, which is a collar on it, which is basically just a t-shirt with a collar buttons.

703
00:44:28,908 --> 00:44:37,581
Scott: or You know in the winter I will wear like a long-sleeve shirt and then since it's so fucking cold a sweater on top of that Because it's so fucking cold, but I do.

704
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,370
Rym: over time it sort of grew on me.

705
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,289
Rym: I really like Hawaiian shirts now, even though I want at one time and it doesn't pass did not and that sort of.

706
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:50,510
Scott: you know You that you got that style that old guy with the mustache in the Hawaiian shirt Birkenstocks and my board shorts, right?

707
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,854
Scott: That's your.

708
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:52,011
Scott: that's who you are but

709
00:44:52,051 --> 00:45:06,429
Rym: I actually like older like for real Hawaiian shirts more than like Just happens to be a short sleeve shirt that has a dumb pattern on it And like it's the fabric and the and the sewing and the cut and the feel way more than what it looks like.

710
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:07,653
Rym: Like.

711
00:45:07,693 --> 00:45:10,690
Rym: I don't really care about the ugly patterns that are traditional on those kinds of shirts.

712
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:20,130
Rym: I just like the fact that I can leave it unbuttoned in the summer and I it basically lets me be wearing a shirt technically But not really wearing a shirt.

713
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,824
Rym: It's basically just kind of a cape with little like armholes in it.

714
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,490
Rym: Like that's my that's my style.

715
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:31,150
Scott: It's actually you know, there's a lot of people in the world who have like it's more quote extreme fashions.

716
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:39,410
Scott: Right, like, you know some crazy goth type person who wears like a crazy giant shoes like a life styler Like they have a scent like guy like there's a lie.

717
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:43,670
Scott: There's a lifestyle fashion thing and actually, you know I've thought about that from time to time like huh?

718
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,774
Scott: I could probably do some of those and you know I don't.

719
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,506
Scott: it's so much fucking effort.

720
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:48,990
Rym: Fuck that.

721
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,978
Scott: Yeah the problem I wake up in the more like.

722
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:57,964
Scott: imagine if I was like gonna be all like metal and we're like Spikes and shit and like, you know get some tattoos.

723
00:45:58,024 --> 00:46:01,790
Scott: It's like it's so much fucking work You wake up every morning and deal with all that nonsense.

724
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:03,330
Scott: Well, it's more than and for what?

725
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:08,570
Rym: To have a wardrobe of anything beyond just formal wear and everything else in sportswear.

726
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,765
Rym: You got to buy that stuff in person and what I say the beginning of the show.

727
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:12,950
Rym: I'm everything online.

728
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:14,969
Rym: So I only go clothes shopping.

729
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:23,873
Rym: when I Run like a prop an article of clothing that I have is worn out and I'm short on that article of clothing and then I have to do what I'm doing.

730
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:35,238
Scott: laundry too often because they don't have enough of a clothe is when I buy a clothe and Usually it's because I take some old clothing give them to the goodwill because they're all messed up Yep, but like and it's like oh shit.

731
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:43,890
Rym: I don't have enough shorts because I just get for them to goodwill Your shirts to where I rotate them such that none of my nerd shirts are wearing out.

732
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:48,190
Rym: So I can't buy more because I have enough nerd shirts to live like a month never doing laundry.

733
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:55,666
Scott: Well sometime, you know over time eventually, you know a shirt will wear out and I'll have to retire it to the under-the-bed store doesn't happen to me anymore.

734
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:56,128
Rym: look at it.

735
00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:04,048
Rym: just look at gig nights videos of our lectures from like 2008 and I'm wearing the same t-shirts that I wear it now.

736
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:09,629
Scott: Last a long time but still some of them like they don't last for that real life sure.

737
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:12,964
Scott: Well, that one is like the oldest of the cafe press.

738
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:23,150
Scott: what I'm not talking about Like by not drawing them you can preserve the art on the front, but other things will happen Like maybe they'll stretch out or maybe you'll get a stain on them or you know things can happen.

739
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:27,710
Scott: Right that can make a shirt go like even like some shirts that are perfectly good.

740
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,110
Scott: They have a tiny hole in them and I'm like, what is that?

741
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,120
Scott: It's like is that a moth that made that hole?

742
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,387
Scott: where the fuck that hole come from?

743
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:33,709
Scott: but it's like.

744
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:33,890
Scott: well

745
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:48,389
Rym: But like my sportswear I do a ton of research and I buy like very specific clothing for very specific reasons and purposes and I spend a lot of time on it because Then I know what I want and I can just order it online Don't have to go anywhere.

746
00:47:48,891 --> 00:48:12,973
Rym: But with real clothes like normal clothes have to go to a clothing store and I only go to a clothing store when ah Shit, I need like I'm like, oh no my linen jacket that I wear all the time at conventions is Fucking worn out and I need new ones and pretty much because I hate going to stores Even though I could do that same level of research and care and like go buy like a bunch of really nice Hawaiian shirts I don't.

747
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:19,610
Rym: I just go to Uniqlo or H&M or one of those places usually both of them because they're like next to each other In this one neighborhood.

748
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:22,220
Scott: They're cheap and they have everything in one store.

749
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:41,822
Rym: and I walk into the store and I just walk around And I and as soon as I find like up here's a pair of jeans that fits me and looks good to replace the jeans ahead before I buy like five pairs of jeans that are the same one just different colors because that's the maximum like Output of clothes per input of time in a store.

750
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:44,110
Rym: and then while I'm there I go over to the shirt section.

751
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,610
Rym: I'm like, are there any Hawaiian shirts here that are good?

752
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,922
Rym: I look at them all and if there are I buy them all.

753
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:49,707
Rym: if there aren't I don't.

754
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:54,190
Scott: yeah I do the same thing where I buy different color because it's like you could do the Steve Jobs.

755
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:58,969
Scott: You just buy the same exact thing a hundred times But it's like I'll buy a different color.

756
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:02,610
Scott: Imagine if you went to work every day doing the same exact clothes.

757
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:06,325
Scott: Yeah, that would be like, uh-huh when project smashmouth concludes.

758
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:07,390
Rym: Maybe I'll do that instead.

759
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:10,461
Rym: I'll wear the same color shirt every day until someone says something.

760
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:13,863
Scott: the advantage is no one knows if you did your laundry and they Can't challenge you on it.

761
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:16,810
Scott: Yep Whereas I you know It's like I'm mostly worried.

762
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:22,870
Scott: The only reason I change clothes really is because I need to let people know that yes, I have done laundry.

763
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:24,774
Scott: Look at me.

764
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,019
Scott: I change clothes.

765
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:48,849
Rym: when I when I had before I was like Respected in my career enough to where people knew who I was and I could kind of like I didn't have to keep selling myself anymore Like when I was trying to rise through corporate ranks and everything like in the old days like when I first got my job in Wall Street and IBM Like I dressed up to work every day like I wore like a suit not a tie but I wore like a suit and a dress shirt and like nice pants.

766
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:51,461
Rym: and like I dressed up every day and I always tried.

767
00:49:51,541 --> 00:50:02,609
Rym: my rule was always Look at all the people who are at my level in the company and all the people who are level above me And I would dress better than the most slovenly person above me.

768
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:04,694
Rym: That was like my rule.

769
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:19,575
Rym: now that I kind of just like him in an unfireable person who like knows stuff and could trivially get a job I Literally wore just like a compression under armor shirt and bike shorts to the office today and like no sock bike shoes Because I just don't care.

770
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:26,923
Scott: Yeah in terms of like office people always talk about like dress for the job you want I'm wearing bike shirts and bike sharp pressing for the job.

771
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:28,830
Scott: I want you know what at least at my company.

772
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:29,969
Scott: I don't have any other companies.

773
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:31,897
Scott: That's total bullshit cuz like.

774
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:34,547
Scott: there are people who are in my team who are like like.

775
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:35,270
Scott: there's another Scott.

776
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,164
Scott: He dresses like, you know, like real dress clothes.

777
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,250
Scott: He cares a lot about fashion.

778
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,714
Scott: He's always like dress it up every day.

779
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:42,500
Rym: Has he been promoted hasn't?

780
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:44,265
Rym: no so I got.

781
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:52,236
Scott: I got a terrible story the car and there's people dressing like way shabbier than me every day and There doesn't affect that right.

782
00:50:52,276 --> 00:51:04,409
Rym: it's like no one gives a show when I was at the broker dealer you know when I first started working for like Wall Street nonsense and I dressed up every day and The dress code at the company was way under what I was dressing as.

783
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:18,630
Rym: so I dressed up and then like my co-workers like we all started dressing up in my one department and no one else in the company did except management and Later on the company put out a thing and they were like we're relaxing the dress code.

784
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:22,426
Rym: You guys can basically wear whatever the fuck you want to the office like shorts.

785
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:24,216
Rym: don't care go nuts Just don't be a slob.

786
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:24,800
Scott: Good job.

787
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,691
Scott: That's the kind of dress code I like.

788
00:51:26,932 --> 00:51:32,430
Rym: so everyone else don't be naked everyone else relaxed a little bit, but we double down.

789
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,274
Rym: We all start wearing suits and ties every day.

790
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:34,915
Rym: Mm-hmm.

791
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:36,117
Rym: And that was just our thing.

792
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:36,799
Scott: I can't stop you.

793
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:45,870
Rym: Yeah, and It actually appeared to bother upper management because it was very clearly a dress for the job you want not the job you have.

794
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:48,928
Rym: Situation because we all knew how like important we were.

795
00:51:48,948 --> 00:51:53,289
Rym: and Then we did a giant company photo for like this big website marketing thing.

796
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:59,729
Scott: Yeah, a bunch of people in suits and standing next to a whole bunch of slobs They actually made all of us take off our suits and ties for the photo.

797
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:07,830
Rym: Mmm, it's because only and and then in the photo they like they composited together Like we didn't take the photo all at once because that no one has a panorama.

798
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:11,810
Rym: Yeah, no one has a panorama that big for like a company with with like hundreds of employees.

799
00:52:12,372 --> 00:52:13,477
Rym: So they like made this.

800
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:17,793
Rym: all the management wearing suits in the photo Management had suits.

801
00:52:17,853 --> 00:52:21,424
Scott: we didn't and I didn't clear in the photo who is a manager.

802
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:22,788
Rym: I quit not long after that.

803
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,229
Rym: Mm-hmm.

804
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:31,062
Rym: And yeah, I got promoted by quitting not by dressing up at my stupid company every day Mmm, the moral is quit to get promoted don't?

805
00:52:31,826 --> 00:52:43,870
Scott: it's actually true Like I've known this for a long time that if you just keep like if I just kept changing jobs like every time recruiters called Yes, I just kept changing CTO some like Dumbo company by now like I'd have so much more monies.

806
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:44,335
Scott: But it's like.

807
00:52:44,376 --> 00:52:45,509
Scott: do I really want to do that?

808
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:52,909
Scott: Maybe it's like I you know Do I go to a bunch of shitty jobs and keep changing like twice a year to just to move up and up and up?

809
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,830
Rym: See I did that but I did it every four years and actually it's weird because now I'm in my fifth year at this company.

810
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,514
Rym: I haven't quit yet.

811
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:00,581
Scott: I'm my seventh year.

812
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:08,162
Rym: Whoa Whoa, Scott the only thing I've done for well other than gig knives in Connecticut I've never done anything in my life for seven years.

813
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:11,039
Scott: Yeah fly years Yeah, but nowhere to go.

814
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:19,170
Rym: every time I've all every time I've quit I've basically like jumped up one full corporate wrong or whatever and it actually worked out super well.

815
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:30,007
Rym: but the one thing about quitting that all like when you quit is that There's that moment when you walk out the door of oh, yeah All that stuff that I had to take care of is someone else's problem now.

816
00:53:30,288 --> 00:53:33,041
Scott: Hmm And then this and no one can call me not as new stuff.

817
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:33,805
Scott: That's your problem.

818
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:37,880
Rym: But the new stuff Is new so I can ask questions and be like wait.

819
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:39,166
Rym: Well, no, I don't want to do that.

820
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:40,030
Rym: What's this?

821
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,357
Rym: No, that's not part of my job.

822
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:43,449
Rym: He didn't know I did not take this job to do that.

823
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:58,213
Rym: But yeah Dressing like out dressing your co-workers or any of that like dress for the job you want Only seems to work in the kinds of jobs that I would never want and never seem to work in any job I ever had.

824
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:01,750
Rym: in fact the people like in like when I was in that hospital.

825
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:08,764
Rym: All the people who dressed like above their station in the job Were kind of not good at their job.

826
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:11,471
Rym: Try hards who were obviously Try hards.

827
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:14,341
Scott: Yeah, if I see someone doing that it reeks of effort.

828
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,010
Rym: Yep, and the moral is never reek of effort.

829
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:22,510
Scott: I mean, I know people who do it who aren't reeking of effort, but it still it feels like that, you know.

830
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:29,279
Rym: Yeah, I feel like I could do that more easily if clothing was not the one thing I have to go to a physical store mostly to buy.

831
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,027
Rym: now there is I mean just do it.

832
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:35,478
Scott: if it's a thing that you Like like you can't you want to do it like you would do it Even if you had no job like?

833
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:39,184
Rym: some of our friends are way more fashionable than us Obviously and that's because that's something care about.

834
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:39,789
Rym: that's awesome.

835
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:40,973
Scott: It's a nerd.

836
00:54:41,074 --> 00:54:41,436
Scott: It's geek.

837
00:54:41,456 --> 00:54:42,623
Scott: It's a geekery like any other.

838
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:46,123
Rym: so I found his service I will not say the name of it on the show.

839
00:54:46,204 --> 00:54:47,109
Rym: There's a couple of them now.

840
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,370
Rym: They're basically blue apron for clothes.

841
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:53,370
Scott: I've seen a lot of those and they all work slightly differently and I thought about trying one.

842
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,748
Rym: I thought about doing one too.

843
00:54:55,091 --> 00:55:00,713
Scott: But and I've seen I went on YouTube and a lot of people like opening and reviewing different ones as a guy who got one Box from all of them.

844
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:03,081
Scott: Whoa, and he reviews like all the different ones.

845
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:03,603
Scott: and it's like.

846
00:55:03,944 --> 00:55:05,830
Scott: the problem is they're all way expensive.

847
00:55:05,891 --> 00:55:07,229
Scott: And it's like well fuck that.

848
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,212
Rym: Yeah cuz blue apron does not cost me that much more than groceries.

849
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:13,442
Scott: see what I really need is not someone to pick out the clothes for me.

850
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:14,887
Scott: is I need somebody?

851
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:17,475
Scott: I need a tailor to Make all the clothes fit me perfectly.

852
00:55:17,756 --> 00:55:25,769
Scott: Yes, even if you go to the store and it's like I have determined that I am medium It's like it's still like like for example, my arms are long, right?

853
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:31,150
Scott: So I'll buy clothes that fit in every aspect except the sleeves are too short and I might go up one size.

854
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:34,208
Scott: Okay, the sleeves are the right length, but it's like a balloon now.

855
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:39,890
Rym: So Scott I don't have that many but I got to tell you so This is definitely a like rich person thing.

856
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:45,110
Scott: So I need you know, it's like I need you know to in any human being is a slightly different size.

857
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:50,730
Scott: So even it's very rare that you will be a person where you can buy clothes from the store.

858
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:55,649
Scott: That will be a hundred percent fitting you perfectly because I'm so you can find the store for you.

859
00:55:56,132 --> 00:55:57,158
Rym: H&M is the store for me.

860
00:55:57,218 --> 00:56:01,517
Rym: their shit fits me real good Like I'm standing 90%.

861
00:56:01,517 --> 00:56:03,342
Scott: but hundred percent is hard to achieve.

862
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:05,068
Rym: so it's got a weird body.

863
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:05,890
Scott: It's even harder.

864
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:08,440
Scott: So it's like, you know, no matter who you are.

865
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,584
Scott: It's like I want a tailor.

866
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:11,513
Scott: They'll make everything fit me 99%.

867
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:20,150
Rym: I got multiple tiers of like fitted stuff and There's one level like you get something that has all the measurement like you have yourself measured by a tailor.

868
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:22,283
Rym: Are you buy a dress shirt while the measurements match you?

869
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:23,490
Rym: Yeah, that's real good.

870
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,850
Scott: If you're buying fancy clothes, you're obviously gonna get them tailored.

871
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,285
Scott: But I'm talking like my every like tailor my jeans tailor my underwear to everything.

872
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:31,710
Scott: So everything perfect.

873
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:38,706
Rym: Several fancy dress shirts that I got mostly for free through work connections because I did.

874
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:44,770
Rym: as wealthy as I am I'm still not the kind of person who will just like hire tailors to tailor me clothes.

875
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:45,716
Scott: That's a lot of money.

876
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:47,830
Rym: It is it is you think it's a lot of money.

877
00:56:47,911 --> 00:56:54,610
Rym: It is so much more money than you think it is Unless you know enough to know how to get a cheap tailor like in Chinatown.

878
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:56,450
Scott: You could also hire a personal stylist.

879
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:01,970
Rym: It's pretty cheap to like get a tailor to like make you a custom suit and like suit stuff.

880
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:06,830
Rym: But if you want like regular old dress shirts or anything, that's like a little bit out of the ordinary.

881
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:11,270
Rym: It's a lot harder to do unless you have a lot of knowledge a connection or a lot of money.

882
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:25,304
Rym: But I have several dress shirts that are like 100% custom tailored With way more measurements than normal tailoring does and Custom like my arms fall a certain way and my shoulders are a certain way.

883
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:26,609
Rym: So they're tailored specifically to me.

884
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:28,517
Rym: Holy fuck.

885
00:57:28,537 --> 00:57:30,210
Rym: Are they the most comfortable things in the world?

886
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,689
Rym: And it's like Oakley's like Oakley's not the best sunglasses.

887
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:36,826
Rym: Their only power is that they kind of make like they look good on anyone.

888
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:38,693
Rym: Mm-hmm The tailored shirts.

889
00:57:39,215 --> 00:57:43,088
Rym: they just make me look like a better human being like they made me look close.

890
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,369
Scott: fitting Mesa is what makes them look good more than anything else.

891
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,896
Rym: That's why I got a lot of respect.

892
00:57:47,937 --> 00:57:59,014
Scott: if you got a really you could go and buy like a ten thousand dollar You know fancy shirt with a name brand on it And if it doesn't fit you perfectly it's gonna look ugly and you could go to the store and buy a five dollar you know.

893
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:00,302
Scott: thing for the from the.

894
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:05,281
Scott: you know, the like What's it called the discount bin?

895
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:11,190
Scott: Yeah, whatever the rack Yeah, the the shittiest like, you know goodwill you can write off the turnip truck.

896
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:15,249
Scott: You can buy clothes from Goodwill and if they fit you perfectly they gonna look good.

897
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,757
Scott: Yeah, that's how it is.

898
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:20,128
Scott: fitting is the most important clothes, right?

899
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:30,951
Rym: but custom tailored clothing I got to admit if I got a lot richer That's the thing I like.

900
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:37,474
Rym: the two things I would probably waste a ton of money on and do like rich person bullshit with would be traveling and Custom clothes.

901
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:38,859
Scott: now there is one problem though.

902
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:46,370
Rym: the tailoring is that if your body changes well Then the tailor changes it and actually that at least for now is not a problem.

903
00:58:46,491 --> 00:58:49,810
Rym: I have a philosophy that I decided on in middle school.

904
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:55,472
Rym: I decided when I was in eighth grade because I got a little bit of a gut probably from drinking nine or ten Dr.

905
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:59,030
Rym: Peppers today and Then I worked out and that got one away.

906
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:11,899
Rym: But I decided that my waist Whatever that size was would never get bigger and I would never in my life ever buy pants That were larger than the pants.

907
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,710
Rym: I had at that time ever.

908
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:18,490
Rym: So if my gut started not fitting in my pants, I'm fucked.

909
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,870
Rym: I either have to squeeze in or lose weight and I'm pretty sure I can keep that going for the rest of my life.

910
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:23,942
Scott: You know what happens though?

911
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:24,549
Scott: Is it in the winter?

912
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:27,859
Scott: And in the summer, uh, and that's like.

913
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:30,570
Scott: well at least that works because I have summer clothes and winter clothes.

914
00:59:31,812 --> 00:59:34,190
Scott: My shorts could have a smaller waist than my jeans.

915
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:35,599
Rym: I actually have that problem.

916
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:45,377
Rym: my shorts do not 100% fit me in the winter and in the summer they almost fall off at me because I just get crazy skinny in the summer You know, but that's how it works.

917
00:59:45,557 --> 00:59:49,387
Rym: Yeah, but I pretty much have decided that barring catastrophic illness or injury.

918
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:53,010
Rym: I Will never need different sizes of clothes from what I wear now.

919
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:56,849
Scott: Well, you get old and you get shorter and you know stuff will happen.

920
00:59:57,191 --> 00:59:57,774
Rym: I'm gonna make sure.

921
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,930
Rym: I'm gonna be that skeletal man who's still jogging when he's 90.

922
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,110
Scott: I hope that he his clothes from you know for 40 years ago don't fit him.

923
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:06,034
Rym: No, just belt.

924
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:06,536
Rym: cinch it in.

925
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:07,560
Rym: just belt it up.

926
01:00:07,862 --> 01:00:09,610
Rym: You can cinch in way easier than you can cinch out.

927
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,775
Scott: It's not gonna look good though.

928
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,969
Rym: No, it's not but at that point I'm basically just a hanger.

929
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:25,668
Rym: Okay, go home This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

941
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:16,334
Rym: We are working on what we're gonna use that money for.

946
01:02:38,776 --> 01:02:42,790

Rym: The past is far behind us.

955
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:14,240
Rym: the future doesn't exist.

956
01:03:14,942 --> 01:03:16,208
Scott: Oh, what's the time?

957
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:18,720
Rym: it's quarter to nine time to have a bath.

958
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,545

01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:32,460
Rym: what should go round like a merry-go-round going so fast like a merry-go-round?

965
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:39,980
Rym: Let's go on a journey a journey through all time the time that's changing all the time.

966
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:44,270
Rym: It's time to go to time But we don't really want to.

967
01:03:44,672 --> 01:03:46,319
Rym: we're going to miss our show.

968
01:03:46,842 --> 01:03:48,430

Rym: that is older And I rot over time.

975
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:17,020
Rym: Time could be told by the moon or the Sun, but time flies fast when you're having fun Mm-hmm there's a time and a place for mucking around.

976
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:26,949
Scott: I'm friends with my dad And then what happened after the olden days?

977
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,994
Rym: Time went new and got old.
