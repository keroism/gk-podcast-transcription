1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,588
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 22nd.

2
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:16,820
Rym: I'm Rym And this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:22,020
Rym: Tonight we talk about how to get into role-playing games twice.

4
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,680
Rym: So a funny little fact about resound the program we use to record GeekNights.

5
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:37,893
Rym: So while you're recording it gives you this nice little interface where you can click and add a queue and it shows you you know Where in the episode you just clicked.

6
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,240
Rym: so I can go back and edit stuff out.

7
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:42,772
Rym: I can add an anchored cue which gives me a cue based on time.

8
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:45,100
Rym: so I could say this is the five-minute mark.

9
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:54,045
Rym: No matter what editing I do It'll always be at the five-minute mark and it shows me the levels and how much I've recorded and how much I can record And how much memory it's taken up.

10
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:55,873
Rym: It shows the DC offset.

11
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:59,452
Rym: I can do a bunch of stuff and Right along the bottom here.

12
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:06,298
Rym: There are three buttons record slash resume stop slash pause and redo slash reset.

13
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:06,880
Rym: now.

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,382
Rym: Well when I do the show I normally click record we do the show click stop and then I click OK and it writes it Out to the disk.

15
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:27,440
Rym: I do point out that redo reset is directly next to stop pause and a little while ago as we had just talked for 26 minutes and change about the news today.

16
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:39,020
Rym: I went to click on stop pause and for some reason I moved a little bit too far to the right and I clicked on Redo reset and before I could even blink the entire show was gone and Rym could die in a fire.

17
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:44,340
Rym: It totally sucked because we didn't know the last time we lost a show.

18
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,767
Scott: I can be done with the show right now.

19
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,888
Scott: I'd be go playing pokemons right now, but no no I'm here talking and saying shit.

20
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,984
Rym: I already said the last time this happened I didn't feel so bad.

21
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,153
Scott: a quantum recorder that can go back and get things.

22
00:01:55,173 --> 00:02:05,210
Rym: I already said back from well You know This is more case that we should just buy an SSR because then we could always record to that Simultaneous to the computer as the backup no matter what happens.

23
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,180
Scott: I've been saying this and you still haven't bought one.

24
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,668
Rym: Well, cuz we're splitting it 50/50.

25
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:13,115
Rym: I'm not dropping 300 bucks on an SSR.

26
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,319
Scott: I'll go find one first.

27
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,531
Rym: Mr Genius, I found several which one a bunch of them.

28
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,774
Rym: They're they're all the same.

29
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:20,476
Rym: They all work.

30
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:22,930
Rym: We'll pick one out All right, then.

31
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:31,978
Rym: Yeah Anyway, we're gonna force ourselves to go through the news again, though We're probably not gonna make all the same jokes we made last time and we're probably not gonna talk for 26 minutes.

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,599
Scott: We'll probably talk for significantly less minutes cuz my pokemons there.

33
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,040
Rym: Luckily much of what we lost was us talking about Puerto Rico, which we played over the weekend.

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,569
Scott: Yes, and we just decided hey, we never.

35
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,555
Scott: I don't think we ever did a Puerto Rico episode.

36
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:52,047
Rym: So we're gonna do one Yep, so luckily you won't have to hear that story twice.

37
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,629
Scott: Nope you won't Okay, so what was the news?

38
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:09,466
Scott: My news is that Nintendo put out a thing that basically listed all the Wii and DS games that are coming out between July and September and most of the games are crap like I don't know Holly hobby and friends.

39
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,850
Rym: all that games gonna be awesome.

40
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,679
Scott: Yeah, Crayola treasure adventures.

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,926
Rym: Oh fuck Advance Wars.

42
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:23,830
Scott: That's my new game Yep, so I'm gonna go over the games that pretty much are gonna be possibly worth playing, you know I'll tell you if they're gonna be definite buys or maybe buys.

43
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:27,630
Rym: I will point out the joke we made last time and I just want to bring this up.

44
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:42,329
Rym: Yeah, and it's been kind of my shtick lately But I can't eloquently will elegantly bring it back in now out the magic's gone But pretty much any time I play any game on the Wii I say it's the best game out for the Wii right now Which lately has been mostly?

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,988
Scott: Soul caliber - I'll tell you that the we everybody votes channel is the best game for the Wii.

46
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,112
Rym: Yeah I don't know.

47
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,044
Rym: ice hockey is really up in the running for the best game on the Wii.

48
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:55,837
Rym: that - cuz the thing is There really aren't any good Wii games.

49
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:57,503
Scott: No, not really not at all.

50
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:02,886
Scott: There aren't gonna be a apparently many more until beyond September.

51
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:04,536
Scott: Cuz the only.

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,929
Scott: there's only two games on this list for the Wii.

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,256
Scott: I hate to say it about.

54
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:16,329
Rym: I would be better off if the Wii were doing less Well, because if it were doing less well, Nintendo would be putting out more games to try to make it do better.

55
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:18,620
Rym: Instead it's still selling.

56
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,670
Rym: it's still sold out practically everywhere.

57
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:25,368
Rym: They're selling so many they could never make a game again and still have made tons of money.

58
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:34,646
Scott: Yep So the first game we're talking about is Mario strikers charged Which is the sequel to Mario strikers and it's coming out for the Wii on July 30th.

59
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:35,810
Rym: I'm looking forward to this.

60
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,630
Scott: Yeah, I think we told this story in the pre.

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,484
Scott: I'm not gonna keep saying that we said things in the pre cuz.

62
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:42,790
Scott: you know what everything we're about to say.

63
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,124
Rym: We already said earlier today, but suffice to say we fucked up when it came to strikers.

64
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,890
Scott: Yes, Mario strikers an excellent game.

65
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:55,750
Scott: I played the store demo and I loved it But I didn't buy it because it was 50 bucks and I thought that that was too much to play for a soccer game.

66
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:59,670
Rym: Never mind the fact that back then we were actually bored and needed games.

67
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:01,961
Scott: We were bored and we needed a two-player game.

68
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:02,524
Scott: badly.

69
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:03,730
Scott: Here was a great one.

70
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,558
Scott: We didn't buy it because we thought it was too much.

71
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:08,510
Rym: We'd stand there in the store like 50 bucks.

72
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,125
Rym: I'd pay 40, but let's just wait until the price comes down.

73
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,450
Rym: and the price never came down.

74
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,634
Scott: It never came down ever.

75
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:15,718
Scott: as a result.

76
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:18,226
Scott: We bought Mario strikers for the same amount.

77
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:19,510
Scott: We're like $50.

78
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:34,490
Scott: We eventually broke down and all that did was we played Mario strikers but we got less fun out of it because we bought it weeks later and we Basically paid the same amount of money in order to have like a couple months less playtime with the game.

79
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:36,699
Scott: I mean we could play it now.

80
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,121
Scott: Maybe we should but it's I don't know.

81
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:42,096
Rym: Suffice to say it's a great game.

82
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:45,970
Rym: And while we played it and enjoyed it we missed out on the Golden Age of it.

83
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,703
Scott: Yep, and in July 30th, it's gonna be replaced by the Wii sequel.

84
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,610
Rym: I'm kind of looking forward to that.

85
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,293
Scott: Yeah, very much.

86
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,560
Scott: So I think it's gonna have internet play.

87
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,143
Scott: So beware.

88
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,450
Rym: Oh, that would be hot.

89
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:56,632
Scott: Alright.

90
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,186
Scott: the next game August 20th Metroid Prime 3.

91
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:00,949
Scott: I'm all about it.

92
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:05,081
Scott: I'm kind of indifferent but uh, his rims-e-heathen who doesn't like Metroid.

93
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:08,290
Rym: I don't terribly enjoy Metroid games now.

94
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,117
Scott: That's all there is to it.

95
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:12,010
Rym: So, uh, what'd you think of Metroid hunters?

96
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,925
Scott: Metroid hunters is probably the only bad Metroid game the only bad Metroid game.

97
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:17,347
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,210
Scott: Can you think of any others?

99
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:22,885
Rym: Uh, see I could be funny and say yeah Metroid But I can't cuz.

100
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,573
Rym: well I didn't I mean.

101
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:33,523
Scott: the one complaint you can have about Metroid Prime 2 is that it was basically the same thing as Metroid Prime 1 only with a different map and they change.

102
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,648
Scott: they had like all the same bad guys But they changed the colors on him.

103
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:37,650
Scott: But you know what?

104
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,950
Scott: It was still more Metroid Prime 1 and Metroid Prime 1 was great and Metroid Prime 2 was just more of the same.

105
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:45,143
Scott: So it was still good.

106
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:45,790
Scott: It wasn't bad.

107
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:49,750
Rym: I think my problem was more with the Metroid Prime games that I played.

108
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:58,837
Rym: FPS is a lot before I got to college and I played FPS is pretty much every single day constantly up until Metroid Prime came out.

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,570
Rym: so Metroid Prime was the first game.

110
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:13,319
Rym: It's not a first-person shooter really but it is a game that takes place in the first person and it was the first First-person game I had played since Goldeneye Where I wasn't using a mouse and a keyboard

111
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,162
Scott: and while

112
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,350
Rym: I know that it's not that kind of twitch game

113
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:16,954
Scott: The

114
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:25,550
Rym: fact that I didn't have the level of control I was so used to just really bothered me and distracted me so much that I couldn't get myself to enjoy the game.

115
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:33,910
Rym: I'm hoping that now that I haven't really played FPS is for a couple years That I can play these Metroid Prime games and not be bothered by that.

116
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:43,722
Scott: Well, I think you'll be significantly helped by the fact that Metroid Prime 3 you'll probably be aiming with the Wiimote Yeah, nunchuck and not trying to use two analog sticks.

117
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,550
Rym: I'm actually kind of looking forward to it for that reason.

118
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:54,850
Scott: Yeah, but in addition to that Personally when I play Metroid Prime You know, I don't get the same feeling as an FPS.

119
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,896
Scott: So it doesn't bother me even though normally it would you know Even on a PC.

120
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:07,950
Scott: if I played descent which is a first-person view game It's like a totally different feeling from playing half-life 2 even though it's a first-person camera.

121
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,753
Rym: No, it's interesting.

122
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:13,210
Scott: understand how someone would be thrown off if they were like a super FPS player.

123
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:27,081
Rym: I think part of it because notice too that all first-person games I use inverted mouse or inverted joystick always no matter what the game is if it's in the first person I cannot deal with it unless it is inverted.

124
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:32,922
Rym: and I think part of the problem for me It's just that I probably played ten times more FPS is than you.

125
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:34,267
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'm

126
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:40,804
Rym: not saying that I'm not saying that as a badge of honor because I played a lot of bad FPS is - yeah I wasted a lot of time with

127
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:41,630
Scott: only good FPS

128
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:46,906
Rym: but I played FPS is constantly for a very long time and I played them a lot.

129
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:53,007
Rym: and I think That because I'm not gonna try to stroke an ego here, but I was really good at FPS.

130
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:53,950
Rym: is I would.

131
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,758
Rym: I was really freaking good at action quake and I think by today's standards You're not so good, but by the olden days.

132
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:05,827
Scott: standards, maybe but I don't know even by today because I remember You'd really don't stand a chance with like the fatality guys.

133
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:06,390
Scott: You got nothing.

134
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,446
Rym: Well, no, I didn't say I was great or the best or even near that.

135
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,310
Rym: I was just really good.

136
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,578
Scott: I don't think you're good on pub servers.

137
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:16,147
Rym: I generally just always come out on top on pub servers.

138
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:16,890
Scott: You have a pub server.

139
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,116
Scott: That's like saying man.

140
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,789
Scott: I'm the I'm the king of the the trailer park.

141
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:30,284
Rym: I'd say that that's really good because beyond that level of being better than most people on a pub server It's like the upper 1% that almost no one has an even chance with.

142
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,529
Rym: it's like this other scale.

143
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,647
Scott: Regardless Metroid Prime 3 definitely gonna buy that.

144
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:40,729
Rym: no matter what I think my brains control of FPS is is all kind of unified into one part of the brain.

145
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,744
Rym: that is Unyielding and will not accept change.

146
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:50,766
Scott: The only other Game that I see for the we worth mentioning is battalion wars 2. and well battalion wars 1 was.

147
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:55,222
Scott: so I knew it was Crap, I didn't buy it cuz I knew it was gonna be crap.

148
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:55,824
Scott: I was right.

149
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:56,627
Rym: Wait a minute.

150
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,046
Rym: You didn't buy it You didn't play it.

151
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:00,037
Rym: How do you know it was crap?

152
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:01,423
Rym: What if it was awesome?

153
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:02,669
Scott: You want to bet on it?

154
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,716
Rym: I will bet you a nickel.

155
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,950
Scott: aha that it was awesome rims classic nickel bet.

156
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:19,008
Rym: Here's my problem Scott and I got into a long discussion about this where basically And you can I can tell how well off I am by how much money I will round down to zero.

157
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,900
Rym: and Currently I will round a nickel down to zero.

158
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:22,865
Rym: a nickel isn't money.

159
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,057
Rym: if I see a nickel I don't bother to pick it up.

160
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:26,165
Rym: if I drop a nickel.

161
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:30,190
Rym: I don't care I will give someone a nickel and not feel that I have lost anything.

162
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,958
Rym: So I'll pretty much bet a nickel on anything.

163
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:36,929
Scott: in other words Rym is not too confident that battalion wars is a good game.

164
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,255
Scott: Don't buy battalion wars people.

165
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,258
Scott: it is basically.

166
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:47,738
Scott: I won't even mention the fact that they supposedly put it in the advanced wars universe Because it is a tarnish upon advanced wars.

167
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,126
Scott: now if ours is great battalion war sucks.

168
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:53,277
Rym: if I was gonna bet eight cents It's a whole different story.

169
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:53,538
Rym: Yes.

170
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,409
Scott: I do also want to say space station tycoon.

171
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:06,830
Scott: now I usually you know who cares about space station tycoon But I've actually been kind of in the mood for one of those tycoon sim type of games lately.

172
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:16,148
Rym: Actually, I really kind of want to play some railroad sim games And well really I want to play railroad tycoon the board game But it's a pain to get it going and we need a bunch of people.

173
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,537
Scott: yeah So I don't know.

174
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,710
Scott: maybe the Sid Meier's railroads came out.

175
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,599
Scott: Maybe when your PC is working you can go get that.

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,245
Rym: I probably will you realize I'm probably gonna buy like 40 games for my PC within a week of getting it working.

177
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,410
Scott: well you can get them on Steam.

178
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:34,390
Scott: Yeah, and you know what that's it for the Wii games for until the fall granted.

179
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:36,843
Rym: Then we're gonna get brawl which is all I get.

180
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,090
Scott: the brawl we're gonna eat the Mario.

181
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,688
Scott: That's what we need and that brawl will probably keep us going for a year while all the other games get developed.

182
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:43,210
Rym: God.

183
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:52,976
Rym: So the Wii is gonna go from a Wii Sports system and nothing more to a brawl system much like the Gamecube was nothing more Than a mechanism for playing Smash Brothers.

184
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,722
Rym: Melee 24/7.

185
00:11:54,722 --> 00:12:00,357
Scott: also the new Mario Party is out now or soon and Yeah, we'll see about it.

186
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,121
Scott: We'll see.

187
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:07,410
Scott: I sort of feel like I should buy it But I but I learned my lesson from previous Mario parties that Mario Party.

188
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,360
Scott: We play it a whole lot, and then we go all right.

189
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:19,794
Rym: It takes forever, but then again I remember that Mario Party was great when I had a lot of free time Because it took a lot of free time, but here's the thing Mario Party.

190
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:24,470
Rym: one thing it does very well is it combines have a bunch of people who are playing a game together?

191
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,078
Rym: And it's a video game.

192
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,290
Rym: so it takes care of all the rules stuff You don't have to worry about it, and yet it allows ample ability to socialize while playing the game.

193
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,297
Rym: Yeah It's kind of a setting for socializing.

194
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:46,490
Rym: the other thing is that if you're playing Mario Party correctly as we talked about in the Mario Party show you will fill all of that spare time between moves trash talking and nothing more.

195
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,790
Scott: I'm sure also the Wii action of the new Mario Party might make it worth buying.

196
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,267
Rym: Maybe I imagine we'll get it and do a show on it.

197
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:57,356
Rym: I It's not like Wario where where I'm wary.

198
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:01,688
Rym: I still think that I don't think it's gonna fall from what Mario Party was.

199
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,050
Rym: it might Not exceed it, but I don't think it's gonna be worse.

200
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:11,216
Rym: Yeah, because you really can't beat the travesty that was Mario where we let's see we just counted How many Wii games.

201
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,805
Scott: not so many two two basically all right?

202
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,809
Scott: Let's count the DS game.

203
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:15,210
Scott: is you ready?

204
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:15,972
Rym: I'm ready.

205
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,160
Scott: July 30th pie cross DS.

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,783
Scott: Wait a minute.

207
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,830
Scott: isn't that the same as the same data strikers?

208
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,696
Scott: I guess I'll be buying a twofer on Amazon.

209
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:23,499
Rym: God damn it.

210
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,020
Scott: Yep.

211
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,528
Scott: Oh, let's see doo doo doo doo doo.

212
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:29,338
Scott: Sim City Maybe Sim City DS.

213
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,384
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

214
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,610
Rym: I don't have patience for those.

215
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,116
Scott: It depends if it's actually.

216
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,269
Scott: if it's like Sim City 2000 then yes, if it's anything else no.

217
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:46,343
Rym: But the thing is Sim City 2000 was ruined for me after I played it for years and one day I just started a city and Built it up and built it up and built it up and it was big as it could be.

218
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:57,730
Rym: and from that point on Like I'd mastered the game and alright I can build those awesome Arcologies and I started slowly filling my city with our colleges, and then I realized that it wasn't a game anymore.

219
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,699
Rym: It just wasn't fun, and I never played Sim City again.

220
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:05,463
Scott: No yeah, I also got tired of Sim City, but lately I'm feeling like I want to play it.

221
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:06,088
Scott: I don't know.

222
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,870
Rym: I want to play some other kind of simulation game.

223
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:14,507
Rym: Maybe I don't know something like a Sim Ant even though Sim Ant was pretty piss-poor.

224
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,650
Scott: I kind of like Sim Ant.

225
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:24,239
Scott: I love the fact that once you've got one got one place going all you did was look at the map of the backyard And every few minutes breed to a new square.

226
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,017
Rym: Oh no no I loved Sim Ant, but at the same time I don't think Sim Ant was a good game.

227
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,146
Scott: No I like Sim Tower a lot.

228
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,036
Scott: Sim Tower I really didn't like.

229
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:33,558
Scott: I like Sim Tower.

230
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,167
Scott: Anyway, DS games here we go.

231
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:35,790
Rym: I like Sim Earth.

232
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,717
Rym: My only goal was to wipe out all life.

233
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,081
Scott: DS games worth mentioning.

234
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,145
Scott: Namco Museum.

235
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,228
Scott: I talked about this before.

236
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,104
Scott: Oh, yeah I'm totally buying it no matter what just for the Galaga.

237
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,070
Scott: the other games are bonus.

238
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:51,855
Scott: Heroes of Mana, maybe it might be some tactics-y action Worms.

239
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,530
Scott: now there is a worms for the DS.

240
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,315
Scott: It kind of sucks though.

241
00:14:55,375 --> 00:15:00,710
Scott: the problem is worms for the DS could potentially be an awesome game of all time super awesomeness.

242
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:04,630
Scott: Well, they're gonna put out worms open warfare 2 for the DS.

243
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:07,910
Scott: Maybe they'll correct the mistakes of the first worms for the DS.

244
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:08,854
Scott: I hope they do.

245
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:13,010
Rym: If they don't I'd rather than just put out scorched earth or gun bound.

246
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,862
Scott: Yeah, without modifying it at all in any way.

247
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,595
Rym: Yeah, because scorched earth I mean worms games are great.

248
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:27,302
Rym: the worms games that have been released on Nintendo systems have been worse than Scorch the first good game like that.

249
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,787
Scott: Yeah, I don't get it man.

250
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:29,470
Scott: It's not hard.

251
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,819
Scott: They've made awesome worms games in the past.

252
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,364
Scott: awesome worms games exist.

253
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:34,830
Scott: Don't modify them.

254
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,050
Scott: Just put the same game on every platform.

255
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,716
Scott: Yeah, the worm that everyone likes.

256
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:41,265
Scott: just take that game and just port it.

257
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,673
Scott: You don't need to update it You don't need to change it.

258
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:44,597
Scott: It's fine.

259
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:45,420
Scott: Everyone loves it.

260
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,170
Scott: Just make it multiplayer and put it on all the console.

261
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,257
Rym: I mean, there's that 3d worms on the GameCube.

262
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:51,502
Rym: That was okay.

263
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,348
Scott: It was okay, but it doesn't need to be 3d.

264
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:54,859
Rym: I want 2d worms.

265
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:55,990
Rym: The 3d was kind of cool.

266
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:05,301
Rym: I think it suffered from the fact that the controls to make a 3d game like that work on a Console with a controller like that just make it not fun.

267
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:06,264
Scott: Yep, basically.

268
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:06,846
Scott: All right.

269
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,170
Scott: next game luminous arc.

270
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,937
Scott: This is coming from Atlas.

271
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,715
Scott: It looks another one of those tactics II kind of games and you know I I'm not.

272
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,910
Scott: I've never been a big fan of the tactics II games like the final tactics.

273
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:40,610
Scott: I never even played any Final Fantasy tactics ever but I played the second Fire Emblem and I kind of liked it like the Gameboy Advance 1 number 2 and the only reason I stopped playing is because I stopped playing it for like a week and then I forgot the plot and what was Going on and everything and I in order for me to get back into the game I felt like I had to start over in the beginning which I didn't want to do and I Starting from where I was I forgot what I was doing.

274
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:43,150
Scott: So it was kind of like got out of the game.

275
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,656
Scott: But if I kept playing it and didn't stop I'd be able to stay in it And I think my interest would hold.

276
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:52,570
Scott: so I might buy one of the tactics II games and see if I can stay in it.

277
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,329
Scott: And without getting bored, I don't know.

278
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:58,330
Rym: I might just force myself to beat one of the Fire Emblems before I go any further.

279
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:02,306
Rym: Maybe maybe because I played them both and then I just kind of stopped.

280
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:03,290
Scott: but you liked him, didn't you?

281
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,759
Scott: I did like him while I was playing him.

282
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:05,262
Rym: You liked him.

283
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,429
Scott: Yeah, which I did too.

284
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:11,150
Scott: But then you get out of it and you're like, huh and it's sort of like this barrier to re-entry.

285
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:26,229
Rym: I guess part of the other problem is that I have played Advance Wars and I like the Advance Wars style of that kind of combat so much Yep, but I also like the the way that you slightly customize like the weapons on the guys.

286
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:29,462
Scott: Yep Yep, and I don't know how everyone's a character.

287
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:35,448
Rym: instead of building units during the map I think those games come in and out of season for me and I think I'm just not in the season.

288
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:49,195
Rym: Yeah Yeah, it seems like those games get into season whenever I have a lot of idle time with my DS Which currently I've been stuck with Pokemon and Pokemon is definitely occupying that space and I've been reading that awesome Dragon book that Emily gave me.

289
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:53,230
Scott: when Pokemon runs out one of these tactics games might come in and fill the hole man.

290
00:17:53,311 --> 00:18:03,757
Rym: Every time I want to play a game other than Pokemon I realized I could be reading that dragon book or playing Pokemon and of course the only game left to mention is In September Phoenix Wright 3.

291
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:05,041
Rym: I guess I should finish.

292
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,665
Rym: Phoenix Wright 2.

293
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:07,528
Scott: Perhaps you should.

294
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:08,170
Rym: I'm near the end.

295
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,736
Rym: I just Pokemon came out.

296
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,804
Scott: Hey, nothing you could do about that.

297
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:12,747
Rym: Nothing in the world.

298
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:17,044
Rym: All right All right, I had I had news about Starcraft 2.

299
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:20,388
Rym: I don't feel like talking about it again I don't think I need to say anything.

300
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,787
Scott: Starcraft 2 is coming out and South Korea is gonna explode.

301
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:29,610
Rym: God South Korea, this is all I'll say if you were unaware.

302
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,789
Rym: South Korea Starcraft is big there.

303
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:39,809
Rym: I mean it was one of the biggest and most popular games in America ever when it comes to PC gaming and RTS is.

304
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:45,490
Rym: But it's kind of transcended that in South Korea, which is already the land of video games.

305
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,737
Scott: Yeah When did Starcraft 1 come out?

306
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:49,261
Rym: fuck if I even remember.

307
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:54,201
Scott: I'm gonna look it up because it came out a long time ago Perhaps pre 2000.

308
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,010
Rym: I remember the year it came out.

309
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,783
Rym: It was the number one selling PC game.

310
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,971
Scott: it came out in 1998.

311
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,739
Rym: that was a long time ago.

312
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,463
Scott: So check this out.

313
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:12,879
Scott: Starcraft came out in 1998 in the US right and It's still the number one game in South Korea.

314
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,643
Rym: that well other than some of those a decade of this game I guess I mean other than possibly a lot of those online games people play.

315
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:21,350
Scott: No, it's still the number one game.

316
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:21,612
Scott: I mean.

317
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:25,171
Scott: sure they play a lot of lineage and Warcraft 2.

318
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,161
Rym: It's number one in that it is a part of their culture.

319
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,710
Rym: if you are really good at that game in Korea.

320
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:32,426
Rym: I am by really good.

321
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,535
Rym: I mean Professional level like you.

322
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,820
Rym: just kick everyone's ass.

323
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,589
Rym: fatality level FPS style only with the RTS is.

324
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:42,003
Rym: You're not just a cool guy on the internet in Korea.

325
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,693
Rym: You're a celebrity Really?

326
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:49,770
Rym: You're on national television and you were basically a professional athlete.

327
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:54,766
Rym: Starcraft tournaments are held on multiple broadcast networks in Korea.

328
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:55,870
Scott: Yeah, check this out.

329
00:19:56,192 --> 00:20:05,818
Scott: Starcraft 2 was officially announced May 19th at blizzards worldwide Invitational in Seoul, South Korea.

330
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,440
Rym: Yeah.

331
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,550
Rym: I mean we have the Super Bowl and those sorts of things here.

332
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:15,544
Scott: They have Starcraft tournaments there South Korea Invitational like you can't just walk up and enter.

333
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:23,526
Rym: this video game tournament Invited is for many people in the United States possibly their idea of utopia.

334
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,211
Scott: I Don't know.

335
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:29,230
Scott: It's just so crazy to think that there is a game development company named Blizzard.

336
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,563
Scott: They just a bunch of guys who make video games.

337
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:38,670
Scott: That's all they do and Somehow they've got an entire country by the balls by the balls.

338
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:47,640
Scott: Imagine this explaining that world Situation to someone from the year 1998 when Starcraft came out.

339
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,830
Scott: just tell them see this game that just came out.

340
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:53,240
Scott: This game is going to hold an entire country hostage.

341
00:20:53,541 --> 00:21:03,062
Scott: They're going to be three television stations in the year Dedicated to this game in South Korea now, it'd just be unbelievable.

342
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:05,127
Scott: It'd be like what crazy.

343
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,310
Rym: what I wonder.

344
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:19,340
Scott: What I really wonder is I mean Japan had enough problems every time a new Dragon Quest game came out on a school day So much trouble that they made a law that you can't release video games on certain days Because people kids won't go to school.

345
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,641
Scott: Wasn't?

346
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:19,741
Scott: it?

347
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,710
Rym: wasn't just Dragon Quest games?

348
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:24,101
Scott: I don't know, but it's definitely because of Dragon Quest.

349
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:24,825
Scott: That's the rumor.

350
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,930
Scott: actually I should look that up on.

351
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,990
Scott: Yeah, that might be just a big story that that might be perpetuating internet for you.

352
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:39,148
Rym: It might be an apocryphal tale and my guard list it is not Above to say that mass chaos did ensue when Dragon Quest games were released in Japan.

353
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:39,790
Scott: That is true.

354
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:56,169
Rym: I think the only solution Korea has is to one tax every single citizen of South Korea for the price of Starcraft 2 and then on the day of launch just airlift boxes into every major city by the millions.

355
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:04,121
Rym: and If you want that tax money back You have to prove before a government body that you do not have any interest in Starcraft and do not wish to play it.

356
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:22,945
Scott: I Think it might just be better if Blizzard just sold the entire game Lock stock and barrel to the South Korean government in one giant lump sum payment Or they could sell it to the North Korean government and then they wouldn't need missiles anymore.

357
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:26,856
Scott: Oh, man Wow, think about that.

358
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,725
Scott: That might actually work.

359
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:42,873
Scott: if Blizzard sold Starcraft 2 to North Korea North Korea could say all right, South Korea You can either become part of North Korea and get Starcraft 2 or you can just stay your South Korea And you know what.

360
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,019
Rym: if they put it to a vote?

361
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:46,010
Rym: I wouldn't have too much confidence.

362
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,990
Scott: No me either that that's pretty scary, right?

363
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:56,805
Rym: It's kind of like didn't Michael Moore go around somewhere saying hey if we gave you a thousand dollars Would you vote to turn over the citizenship of your state to wherever?

364
00:22:56,865 --> 00:23:01,405
Rym: and most people said yes Yeah, sure Starcraft is worth a lot more than a thousand dollars.

365
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:13,000
Rym: to a lot of people in Korea It sure is Things of the day.

366
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,910
Rym: I think this is pretty cool.

367
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:23,075
Rym: It's a someone took a bunch of yarn and they made an Atari 2600 complete with controllers and a TV and on the TV is Pitfall.

368
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:23,640
Rym: does it work?

369
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,661
Scott: Yes Awesome.

370
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:26,268
Rym: No

371
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:46,282
Scott: Yeah, I'm glad they chose pitfall as the game because that is one of my Preferred Atari 2600 games because actually out of all the Atari 2600 games I think pitfall is the most slick and stylin and smooth and polished whereas a lot of the other ones are Rough around the edges to say the least.

372
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:46,825
Rym: Yes.

373
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:47,187
Rym: Yes.

374
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:55,481
Rym: Yes Now the fact that it was pitfall was the only reason it was pushed over the edge and to be in my thing of the day Watch out for them scorpions.

375
00:23:55,541 --> 00:24:00,420
Rym: I just love that noise Man, you always had to be a chump to go underground.

376
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,910
Rym: cuz underground just sucked and you couldn't get very far.

377
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,486
Rym: There's always scorpions and walls and almost no treasure.

378
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:14,770
Scott: Yeah Basically the whole game is Stay above ground unless there's a treasure underground in which case go down there and get it then immediately come back above ground where?

379
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,392
Scott: It's much safer.

380
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,480
Scott: I don't know why you would ever go underground.

381
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,086
Scott: scorpions are so hard to get past.

382
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:26,110
Scott: Yeah All right, my thing of the day if you ever played the game Contra Rym, you know Contra 1 for the NES.

383
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:33,563
Scott: Oh, I remember that was the game where game that made the Konami code famous the game where you'd put in the Konami code And it'll give you 30 lives and you thought I gave you 70 love.

384
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:37,660
Rym: no gave you 30 All right, and then you have three continues of those 30 lives.

385
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:38,443
Scott: Oh, that's right.

386
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:43,620
Rym: That's how and despite that I still half the time couldn't beat that fucking game.

387
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,970
Scott: Yeah Contra was a platforming shooting game.

388
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,379
Scott: You basically walk to the right.

389
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,250
Scott: you couldn't walk back to the left, you know Cuz they would only scroll one direction and you could shoot your machine gun.

390
00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:01,624
Scott: you could get different weapons in your machine gun, but it was always a machine gun of some sort and You'd shoot bad guys and walk to the right a few levels.

391
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,310
Scott: you would walk up instead of to the right.

392
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:07,506
Scott: You'd walk into the screen, but it wasn't that much different and eventually you got.

393
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:11,504
Scott: it was sort of like You know a space shooter only without the flying basically.

394
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:12,649
Scott: It's just the platforming.

395
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,810
Scott: Well Contra was a fucking hard game only really really good people could beat it.

396
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:20,829
Scott: I could beat like two levels and then I would like die in the third level.

397
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:27,469
Rym: My brother and I would often put the code in play two-player and then fight to get to the end and half the time.

398
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,014
Rym: the Goal was all right.

399
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:33,188
Rym: We just have to beat one more level before we continue and we're okay.

400
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:39,950
Scott: Yep Well some guy on the Internet's made a video of not a speedrun of Contra.

401
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:41,182
Scott: No speedrun.

402
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:45,771
Scott: who cares, you know You can get some computer to figure out how to get through this game as fast as possible Whatever.

403
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,919
Scott: and it doesn't appear to me.

404
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,208
Scott: I do not believe that this is a machine.

405
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:50,870
Scott: assisted run.

406
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:56,390
Scott: I believe a hundred up almost a hundred percent that this is an actual video of someone playing the game.

407
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,301
Scott: I mean I can tell by the way he's playing that it's not a machine.

408
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:02,045
Rym: I can tell by the pixels.

409
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:02,667
Scott: Yes.

410
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:11,556
Scott: Well also If it's uh, if it is a machine playing then they have done a very good job of masking The fact that it is a machine playing.

411
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,530
Rym: what the player might have done is use save states here and there before troubled spots.

412
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,736
Rym: You might not have done it all in one.

413
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:17,359
Scott: go up.

414
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,244
Scott: That is possible.

415
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,290
Rym: There's no real way to know.

416
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:26,673
Scott: There's no way to know but I'm pretty confident that this is actually a real run through Contra with no Deaths.

417
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:28,337
Scott: he did not die.

418
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:29,701
Scott: now keep in mind Contra.

419
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:30,824
Scott: one hit you die.

420
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:35,900
Rym: Not only that there's bullets Everywhere and constantly the game.

421
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,490
Rym: I have the time especially in the later levels.

422
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,944
Rym: It's literally up dead dead dead dead dead.

423
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:48,550
Scott: This guy beat Contra in this video without getting hit at all without dying.

424
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:55,109
Scott: he didn't beat it as fast as possible, but he beat it pretty damn quickly and he just mowed right through the game.

425
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:59,709
Scott: and it's Amazing and you should watch this cuz conscious not really that long if you don't die.

426
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:04,224
Rym: Yeah, the game always seemed like this long terrible struggle that took hours.

427
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:06,130
Scott: But yet there's only like five levels.

428
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,780
Scott: I know six or seven not too many.

429
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,064
Rym: It doesn't take that long to beat.

430
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,530
Rym: It's just I guess I sucked.

431
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,500
Scott: I also said I think we also.

432
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,610
Scott: I think if I practiced it now I could get good.

433
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:21,822
Rym: Have any of you out there ever Beaten Contra or even gotten to the end or even gotten me.

434
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:28,081
Rym: I did save states on an emulator once without Cheating or using the Konami code or using an emulator.

435
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:29,344
Scott: not probably nobody.

436
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:32,575
Rym: well, at least without the features of an emulator I guess you can use an emulator.

437
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:32,976
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:43,794
Rym: Yeah, so as we've probably mentioned in the first half of the show we're now recording the second half of the show and then we're gonna go back and record the first half of the show that I Stupidly deleted.

439
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,926
Rym: Damn you reset button rims fault.

440
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:48,010
Scott: It is my fault.

441
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:49,860
Scott: You owe me something.

442
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:50,928
Rym: What do I owe you?

443
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,965
Scott: I did all that hard work of talking and now you just threw it away.

444
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,010
Scott: So you owe me something.

445
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,632
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

446
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:59,403
Rym: I give you the talking I put into that thrown away footage.

447
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:08,387
Scott: So we're even but I don't you threw that Away, also, that's like it's like if I gave you something you threw it away And then you were gonna pay me back with some money, but then you threw the money away.

448
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:09,271
Rym: all fine You know what?

449
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:14,547
Rym: I will give you the market value of the portion percentage of the geeky episode of GeekNights.

450
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:15,370
Rym: That was lost.

451
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:20,797
Rym: Alright sure Good game Creative Commons.

452
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:25,854
Scott: Hey, if one day we ever, you know get some royalties or so Who knows some?

453
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:28,470
Scott: no because on this particular episode?

454
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:36,124
Rym: I'm gonna get your head except that no matter what we sold the episode for It's still available for free under the Creative Commons.

455
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,450
Rym: Thus making the value zero.

456
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:49,029
Scott: No, no, no if we let's say we satellite radio pays us five bucks to air this episode Normally, I would get 250 and you'd get 250 but for this episode in this episode alone I get five bucks.

457
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:53,570
Rym: No, it wouldn't be five bucks because we have to prorate it based on the percentage of the show actually lost.

458
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:58,388
Rym: So the longer we retalk the less your money's worth, I guess.

459
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:58,609
Scott: so.

460
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:02,080
Scott: Anyway, we're gonna do the first half of the show real short.

461
00:29:02,562 --> 00:29:07,076
Rym: It is getting into it weak and yesterday We talked about getting into Linux tonight.

462
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:11,110
Rym: We were gonna talk about getting into German board games, but that's kind of easy.

463
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:13,963
Scott: Yeah, play Settlers of Catan then play other games.

464
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:15,209
Scott: Puerto Rico's a good one, too.

465
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:18,950
Rym: Plus we actually kind of talked about that a lot just as a side.

466
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:22,830
Scott: So it's also something that's talked about a great deal on the Internet.

467
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:28,390
Rym: But something that's not talked about a great deal on the Internet is how to get into role-playing games.

468
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:38,817
Scott: Yeah I mean the only place I've seen talk about how to get into role-playing games is the Dragon's Landing Podcast and they talk about it here and there and Most of their advice is okay.

469
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,127
Scott: Well some of their advice kind of normal.

470
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,417
Rym: I'll just admit I don't really I wasn't a big fan of their show.

471
00:29:43,437 --> 00:29:44,401
Scott: I stopped listening to the show.

472
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:45,646
Scott: I'll admit right now.

473
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:50,470
Rym: Yeah, okay There don't seem to be too many good D&D podcasts out there in general.

474
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:57,244
Scott: No, I mean some of them tried to you know, do the thing where they record their own campaign But that I don't see why anyone would listen to that.

475
00:29:57,606 --> 00:30:04,533
Rym: but pretty nerdy I guess you could do it with the proper cast of Burning Wheel, but Regardless Real.

476
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:07,181
Rym: briefly the purpose of this week is most we have.

477
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:08,586
Rym: we have two audience in mind.

478
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:17,174
Rym: audience number one We are talking to people who are interested for whatever reason in geekeries that they are not currently Involved in.

479
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:20,610
Scott: and yeah, if you're you know, there's a lot of geeks out there.

480
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,613
Scott: They're just anime geeks.

481
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:26,690
Scott: and it's always kind of weird like going to an anime convention and people there like don't know about computers.

482
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,529
Scott: And I'm like, are you a geek or not?

483
00:30:29,031 --> 00:30:34,850
Scott: It's like because I'm used to hanging around with a group of geeks that are pan geeks Renaissance geeks.

484
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,297
Scott: We know computers, you know anime we know video games.

485
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:38,359
Scott: We know everything.

486
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:43,421
Scott: so we run into these people that just like anime They don't know video games.

487
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:45,936
Scott: They don't know Freaking board games.

488
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:47,221
Scott: They don't know role-playing.

489
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:48,065
Scott: They don't look computers.

490
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:49,410
Scott: They just know anime.

491
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,237
Scott: Yeah, if you're the type of geek who only knows video games, you just play Guitar Hero 2 all day and night You don't anything else.

492
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:56,225
Rym: That's a pretty good life.

493
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:56,830
Scott: It's a good day.

494
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,200
Scott: It's a good life, but or you're a computer nerd.

495
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,284
Scott: You don't know anything else.

496
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:01,630
Scott: We're gonna help you out.

497
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,011
Scott: We're gonna.

498
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:07,929
Scott: we're gonna teach you how to get the role-playing groove on and maybe spread out your geek isms to other areas.

499
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,089
Rym: now Audience number two and this is very important.

500
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:17,670
Rym: We are also targeting this at people who are into something and want to get other people into said thing.

501
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:21,943
Scott: Yeah, like let's say you're role-playing but your friends they don't like the role-playing.

502
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:23,087
Scott: They're always going.

503
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:23,970
Scott: what's with your role-playing?

504
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:30,710
Scott: Like I know a lot of people they play that they want to play the German board games But their friends won't do it and they can't get their friends to do it.

505
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,230
Scott: Even if they have friends, they can't get them to play the German board games like a struggle.

506
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:41,770
Scott: Well, we're gonna help you because you can just make those friends listen to this episode and then they will hopefully get into role-playing

507
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:50,989
Rym: or in the very least use the techniques that we're Presenting here because a lot of the ways people try to get their friends into things tend to be very counterproductive.

508
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:56,914
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I want to get someone to the Linux so I'll just be like, yeah Go straight to here.

509
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:58,138
Scott: You got to do Linux from scratch.

510
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,664
Scott: No, it doesn't work.

511
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:01,370
Rym: or you want to get someone into anime.

512
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:04,169
Rym: So you show them all your favorite anime?

513
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,685
Rym: Including the really obscure weird crap that you like because you've never seen anime before.

514
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,560
Scott: Nope Well, I think you might like it here.

515
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,398
Scott: Watch my favorite show Genji Ken.

516
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,574
Scott: Yeah Guess what people?

517
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:21,330
Scott: if you show someone Genji Ken who's never seen anime before they're never gonna watch anime ever again.

518
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,928
Scott: It's just how it's gonna be I guarantee unless they're a weirdo.

519
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,980
Rym: So I guess what is a role-playing game?

520
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,768
Rym: because a lot of people have a lot of different definitions though I think most people What they think of when they hear role-playing games that aren't video games is Dungeons & Dragons D&D.

521
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:43,190
Scott: That is what most people think of and they a lot of people think that that's the only role-playing all tabletop role-playing.

522
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:44,758
Scott: We're not talking about larping here.

523
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,247
Rym: Nope, totally different.

524
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:57,195
Scott: Yes tabletop role-playing is basically in my definition is You get a bunch of friends together and you tell a story but you don't just tell a story like in the old Storytelling days.

525
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,870
Scott: you tell a story using a particular structure.

526
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:27,396
Scott: what you do is you have one person who is sort of like the chief story guiding guy or girl and They sort of hold everything together the setting the events and all sorts of random lesser Important characters and each other person playing telling the story Controls one character one of the main characters in the story and all they can do to tell the story is say what their one Character who is a main character does.

527
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:39,230
Scott: so all the actions and happenings and speakings and dialogue of the main Characters are each controlled by one real person and everything else is typically controlled by one more person.

528
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:42,829
Rym: So it's collaborative storytelling pretty much straight up.

529
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:47,570
Rym: But because I mean you could do this without any rules you could get a bunch of friends together.

530
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,910
Rym: This used to be a pastime in high school and middle school a lot around the campfire.

531
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:58,369
Rym: People would just make characters come up with a quick setting and with absolutely no rules Just kind of roleplay and come up with the story over the course of it.

532
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:07,625
Rym: Yeah, but as we've often found in our lives oftentimes the Limitations that are placed upon you are what caused you to excel or to do something.

533
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,632
Rym: You never would have thought you'd do So.

534
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:16,897
Rym: role-playing games are systems that we use to create a Framework around which we can roleplay.

535
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:23,228
Rym: it sets the boundaries it sets the rules it sets at sometimes arbitrariness sometimes luck randomness.

536
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:30,310
Rym: It gives you a method of having order and it forces you to take the storytelling in most likely more interesting direction.

537
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:41,683
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you're just allowed to tell whatever story you want I'll be like alright my guy spreads wings and flies and up to the top of the castle and he fights the evil wizard But he's more powerful than evil wizard and he beats him and I'm the hero.

538
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,128
Scott: Haha and the end of the story.

539
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,070
Scott: now It's not so interesting.

540
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:49,739
Rym: It might be easy to say that oh Well, if you have discipline then that won't be a problem.

541
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:52,630
Rym: and role-playing systems and games are just for people who lack discipline.

542
00:34:53,132 --> 00:35:09,279
Rym: And that is really not true because the systems themselves I think serve in most cases Well, maybe not most cases in a few special cases to enhance the role-playing and I think that like we said the limitations and the rules Actually end up bringing about a better story.

543
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,930
Scott: Yeah plus think about telling whatever story you want is not so fun.

544
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:20,010
Scott: What's what is fun is being challenged to tell a story about something specific like, you know that nanofictionary card game.

545
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:27,350
Scott: Yep It's like you get these cards and you have to tell a story about what the cards say and that's when it's fun because it's like.

546
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:35,129
Scott: Okay, here's a challenge for you, you know, let's see if you can you know beat this challenge tell the best story You can using these elements.

547
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:39,013
Scott: So when you're playing D&D good D&D It's no different.

548
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:44,370
Scott: when you're in a fight you roll some dice to see how the fight turns out and you're forced to roleplay.

549
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,779
Scott: You know the results of whatever that is.

550
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,104
Scott: who knows what the results will be?

551
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:49,670
Scott: but you're forced into it.

552
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,949
Scott: It's just like nanofictionary forced you to tell a story around some cards.

553
00:35:53,472 --> 00:36:04,977
Rym: I remember when I was young and I was in middle school and I was trying to get other kids into D&D so I could play a game because it was incredibly hard to find people other than at Conventions who wanted to roleplay with me.

554
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,770
Rym: So I remember once very one specific conversation.

555
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:15,547
Rym: I was trying to explain to someone what the game is and they were dubious and The only way I could really explain it because they're like, well, how do you win?

556
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:15,969
Rym: What do you do?

557
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:24,645
Rym: And I said well basically you just say what your character does and they do it and there's rules about how to resolve that and They couldn't understand it.

558
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,154
Scott: They absolutely it's not.

559
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:34,690
Scott: and the problem is a lot of people go into it and you say game and they automatically think You know in the structure of a game this winning this losing this competition this rules.

560
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:46,288
Scott: I need to make decisions or do certain things in order to achieve victory something something and that's where you get the role-playing of dungeon Crawling collecting treasure whatever but those people might as well play hero quest.

561
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:54,449
Rym: now I'm gonna narrow our definition a little bit here because we're talking about role-playing games and tabletop role-playing Yep, and Dungeons & Dragons and all that sort of thing.

562
00:36:55,012 --> 00:37:00,150
Rym: But there are two very different schools of thought and how to play and I think that both are equally valid.

563
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:06,590
Rym: So for the time being I'm going to ignore beer and pretzels D&D, but I'm going to come back to that point.

564
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:19,088
Rym: yeah, so if you think that I am what I'm about to say and the thing Scott is also about to say are Disparaging straight-up beer and pretzels Dungeons & Dragons don't get any other sorts of beer and pretzels role-playing because there are.

565
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:19,830
Scott: there are many types.

566
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,173
Rym: We'll come back to that.

567
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:27,210
Rym: Yes, but for starters, we're just going to talk about role-playing games where the intent is to role-play.

568
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:31,097
Rym: now another way to look at this is Basically, you're acting.

569
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:39,834
Rym: everyone is acting in a play But you're also the audience of the play and instead of having a script you have a rule book that tells you what the rules Are for acting.

570
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:47,745
Scott: you're also the not only the audience and the actors But you are the writers and the screenwriters and the director and every.

571
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:51,929
Scott: well the DM is more to the director But yeah, you're everything in the play all at once.

572
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:54,803
Scott: So you're getting the entertainment from watching other people act.

573
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,516
Scott: you're acting yourself You're facing challenges of.

574
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:10,287
Scott: you know what to act you're improvising you're being directed at you're directing You're doing everything that's involved all at once without the fancy lights in the fog machines and such.

575
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,554
Rym: now How do you get into?

576
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:27,878
Rym: role-playing is a very difficult question because I hate to say it But the majority of people who play Dungeons & Dragons or any sort of role-playing game Don't actually role-play or role-play in such a Limited or shallow yes shallow.

577
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,410
Rym: I believe is the perfect word manner that it's not really role-playing at all.

578
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:35,772
Scott: Yeah, like if you ever watch that famous thing of the day That's still one of our.

579
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,237
Rym: are there any girls there?

580
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:39,625
Rym: cuz if there are I wanna do them.

581
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:40,809
Scott: Oh, that's a good one.

582
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:42,707
Scott: I was thinking of a murder duck.

583
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:48,317
Scott: That is the typical D&D game.

584
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,690
Scott: yes of people who don't know how to play properly.

585
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:52,535
Rym: So rule number one here.

586
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:59,465
Rym: the first thing we have to get across is that if you think that role-playing is like that you have Been watching the wrong people role-play.

587
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,534
Scott: well well No, you've you.

588
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:07,957
Scott: role-playing is like that for a great many people, but though most people do it wrong Yes, again.

589
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,385
Rym: Don't worry about beer and pretzels.

590
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:10,269
Rym: We'll come back to that.

591
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:14,070
Rym: well Yeah, I think we can stop saying that I got it because I don't want someone to go.

592
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,860
Scott: Oh, you're making fun of my D&D.

593
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,846
Scott: well they can shut up.

594
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:26,298
Rym: But So many people who I've tried to get interested in Dungeons & Dragons throughout my life for any role-playing game Always come back with.

595
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:43,700
Rym: but I played it once in high school and it was totally lame and it was a bunch of nerds sitting around a table fighting, but goblins in a square dungeon and rolling to see how many maidens they had sex with afterward and they were creepy and they hit on me if it was a Girl, and it was just garbage.

596
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:50,090
Rym: and anytime we tried to do anything the DM Would just make sure it didn't work, and we spent more time rolling dice and no one was ever in character.

597
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,235
Rym: No one even had a character.

598
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,425
Rym: They were just fired are very right.

599
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:58,663
Scott: that is garbage And that's not good D&D and sadly that is the majority of D&D.

600
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,629
Rym: yep that has become the stereotype of D&D.

601
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,696
Scott: So how do you get into the good role-playing?

602
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,750
Scott: well step one if you've never role-played before you pretty much?

603
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,934
Scott: Can't do it on your own.

604
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,182
Scott: You don't if you get it, but you can.

605
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:11,468
Rym: it's called writing a novel.

606
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:18,870
Scott: yes Well, I mean even if you find some other people who have never role-played before let's say you get five people And none of you have ever role-played.

607
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,856
Scott: It's not going to be easy.

608
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:28,403
Scott: you need to find someone somewhere who knows has done this before Properly and in the good way to help you out.

609
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:31,837
Rym: now for any of you who are lucky We are going to give you the easy way out.

610
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:48,068
Rym: if you ever see a gaming convention where a man by the name of Luke Crane is going to be there running an event Just go and talk to him and he will convince you whether you want to or not to join one of his games and at The end of it you will know exactly what role-playing is.

611
00:40:48,891 --> 00:40:57,590
Scott: But if you are not so fortunate you can still go to a gaming convention near you and maybe if you're lucky There will be some people there that are role-playing properly.

612
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:11,829
Scott: You could probably tell because if you sit down with them or if you look over at their table They will be laughing and having a good time and some people will stand up and say dramatic things or something like that as opposed To a bunch of scary nerds who smell going rolling dice a whole

613
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:12,633
Rym: lot You can.

614
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:24,978
Rym: the easiest way to tell if some people are actually Role-playing is if you come upon them while they were arguing or talking and you think for a second that they're actually Arguing or that they're actually angry at each other.

615
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:30,483
Scott: you can pretty much tell looking at a table of people who are playing an RPG Whether that RPG is good or not.

616
00:41:30,664 --> 00:41:31,430
Scott: It's not difficult.

617
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,540
Rym: Well, I guess what are the signs of good role-playing?

618
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,204
Rym: and then we can go through.

619
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,510
Rym: what are the signs of bad role-playing?

620
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:36,915
Rym: Cuz I think they're pretty evident.

621
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:40,125
Rym: Okay, good role-playing a lot all the things we just said.

622
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:49,838
Scott: people yelling people People speak ending up in the first person people look like they're being passionate about something Not so many dice being rolled.

623
00:41:50,159 --> 00:42:02,269
Rym: if when dice are rolled people stop and pay attention Yeah, if characters will walk away from the table and in character continue to discuss That's a good one anything like that.

624
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:10,516
Rym: Basically, if you see people who are acting in any capacity or even if they're trying to act even if they're not doing a good Job, they're trying to be in character.

625
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:12,501
Rym: their characters have motivations.

626
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:14,566
Rym: It's not just a dungeon crawl.

627
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,090
Rym: There's an actual story.

628
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:16,772
Scott: Yep.

629
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:20,770
Scott: Yeah, because remember we said before that role-playing is acting.

630
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:33,097
Scott: So if you come across some people role-playing and they're doing a good job of it You're gonna feel sort of like you're watching a play might not be a good play But it'll be entertaining to watch Unlike two people playing Puerto Rico.

631
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,347
Scott: not so fun, but it's not really a spectator game.

632
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:43,064
Scott: Puerto Rico But Nora's hero quest but D&D played right is very much a spectator game.

633
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:46,816
Rym: now from the perspective of a player Actually in a game.

634
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:49,550
Rym: Here are some of the signs of bad role-playing.

635
00:42:49,891 --> 00:43:03,942
Rym: First and foremost is if you have a dungeon master or a game master Whoever who no matter what the players attempt or what the players put forth He always foils it and it's kind of adversarial him against you.

636
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:04,764
Scott: That's bad.

637
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:06,950
Rym: That is generally not good role-playing.

638
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:15,090
Scott: yeah, if you have a Dungeon master who no matter what you do, they may not foil you but they don't let you go off the road.

639
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:21,648
Scott: You know, it's like let's say you're in a town and you say well I want to do this because that's what your character would want to do and the dungeon master is like I don't know.

640
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:24,973
Scott: a large tree blocks your path or The guards.

641
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:29,465
Scott: don't let you go that way or you go there and the the store is closed.

642
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,010
Scott: go to where the story that I?

643
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,716
Scott: Wrote is.

644
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:32,990
Scott: that's not good.

645
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,155
Scott: It's called railroading and that is bad.

646
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:49,730
Rym: if you're playing and the only setting that seems to exist is the town outside of the dungeon Confrised of 10 foot by 10 foot squares or the dungeon comprised of 10 foot by 10 foot squares full of monsters inexplicably.

647
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:51,696
Scott: Yeah, that's also bad.

648
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:57,570
Scott: if you spend more time rolling dice than talking Mmm, that's pretty much what it comes down to yes.

649
00:43:57,911 --> 00:44:02,269
Rym: or if you spend most of your time in combat regardless of whether or not you're rolling dice.

650
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:05,582
Rym: if In combat, no one speaks in character.

651
00:44:05,883 --> 00:44:14,490
Rym: Everyone just talks tactics Mmm, I mean if you're sitting around a table and oh well you cast blah blah blah And then I'll circle back 10 feet and do this and you do this and we'll do this.

652
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:15,534
Rym: Oh, we got to heal him.

653
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:19,010
Rym: Oh fireball the Lynch blah blah blah and no one says anything in character.

654
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,304
Rym: You're just playing World of Warcraft in person.

655
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:22,290
Rym: You're not actually roleplay.

656
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,535
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people do that though, and I don't know why they use D&D to do that But you could.

657
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:29,309
Scott: there are a lot better systems to do that sort of.

658
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:35,610
Rym: well I'll admit that happened to our group quite a bit and we realized it and we forced ourselves to stop and get back in character.

659
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:48,005
Scott: Yeah, it was so weird though It's cuz like we played D&D to be combat which we kind of expected and did but like I would just when it happened I just kind of sat there bored because it took a whole lot of time and blah.

660
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:48,427
Scott: Yep.

661
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:49,310
Scott: I didn't like it.

662
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,745
Rym: see here's another very subtle hint.

663
00:44:52,785 --> 00:45:01,253
Rym: if you're playing a game if Combat should be dramatic if there is a fight if there's a conflict in a role-playing game It should matter.

664
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:02,317
Rym: you should care.

665
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:14,877
Rym: if you're ever involved in a conflict where you don't care and it doesn't matter Barring the chance that your character actually doesn't care and that it couldn't affect them then Why are you even having the conflict?

666
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:17,126
Rym: because it's not part of the role-playing experience.

667
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:17,910
Rym: It's just crufts.

668
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:23,690
Scott: Yep Now a lot of people will tell you that if you want to get into role-playing and you can't find people to do it with.

669
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,820
Scott: You know your local game store is just a bunch of scary people.

670
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,663
Scott: You don't have one.

671
00:45:27,984 --> 00:45:29,710
Scott: You can't find any conventions nearby.

672
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:31,970
Scott: You don't have any friends who will do it with you.

673
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:37,789
Scott: a lot of people will say hey, you can go role-play in forums online and There you can get into it.

674
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:47,841
Scott: Well, I actually disagree with those people for the most part while it is possible to do lots of you know forum role-playing stuff And this stuff is widespread across the internet.

675
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:54,040
Scott: In fact, we played in a game for quite some time Yep, and there's IRC role-playing and all sorts of other things.

676
00:45:54,461 --> 00:46:05,250
Scott: It is my opinion that tabletop role-playing does not work Basically well enough in knowing you're not in person to warrant doing especially if that is your first role-playing experience.

677
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,290
Scott: That's just bad.

678
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:20,503
Scott: I mean if you've played role-playing games before and you know what you're doing and You just want to do something in a forum, you know more power to you, but as a first experience Forum D&D or forum tabletop role-playing of any kind.

679
00:46:20,523 --> 00:46:22,490
Scott: I don't think it's gonna work for you.

680
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,261
Scott: You're gonna not get the right feeling from it.

681
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:26,867
Scott: You're not gonna know what to do.

682
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,232
Scott: so much It.

683
00:46:28,473 --> 00:46:31,121
Scott: I just don't think it works out and I've seen a lot of people.

684
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:34,935
Scott: they try to get into that and then they go To the forum a couple times.

685
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:38,210
Scott: they never come back and that's that and now they turned off from role-playing forever.

686
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:39,916
Scott: So don't do that.

687
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:41,504
Rym: So then how do you get into it?

688
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:42,590
Rym: How do you find a gaming group?

689
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,217
Rym: What if you're in a town and you're you?

690
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,670
Rym: you think you're the only person who was interested in role-playing?

691
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,894
Rym: You own all the Dungeons & Dragons books But you've never actually played.

692
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:54,430
Scott: you go to Craigslist and you find people and you say hey man, what's up?

693
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,609
Scott: And you make sure they're not scary.

694
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,989
Rym: Yep Or or more likely especially since a lot of you probably I haven't been to college yet if you haven't role-played at all.

695
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:17,033
Rym: I played a lot of D&D in high school and such but when I went to college Particularly if you go to a big or more importantly a nerdy school You will automatically find a lot of people who are into these things and a good percentage of them will probably be pretty good At it.

696
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:23,930
Scott: Yeah, I learned how to play D&D Accidentally, I went to nerdy summer camp where I was pretty much forced to play D&D at the nerdy summer camp.

697
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:29,822
Scott: So go to nerdy summer camp if you're a little kid and that'll teach you some D&D's Yep, but I guess the.

698
00:47:29,963 --> 00:47:41,706
Rym: the moral is don't lose Hope because before I found people to play with I did in fact own all the D&D books and I knew like one kid Who knew about D&D and he was really scary and I avoided him at all costs because he was.

699
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:49,322
Rym: I really didn't want to play In a game with him and I read the books all the time, but I had no one to play with Yep, and then I found people to play with.

700
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:50,670
Rym: eventually you just got to stick to it.

701
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:59,143
Scott: The thing is is a lot of people sometimes have a hard time getting into role-playing because they start out of course trying to play Dungeons & Dragons, which is fine.

702
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:00,089
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that.

703
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:06,490
Scott: But Dungeons & Dragons is sort of like this high fantasy world high fantasy system.

704
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,350
Scott: There's magic and spells and wizards and all this sorts of stuff.

705
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:16,097
Scott: It's also in my opinion not a very good system all things considered No but it works and it teaches you role-playing and it.

706
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:30,075
Scott: the thing is it only works on nerds and it seems that because of Most role-playing game systems tend to be centered on high fantasy or science fiction cyberpunk type things that it's really

707
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:31,579
Rym: a whole genre

708
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:41,770
Scott: of gaming that is sort of restricted to geeks and geeks only and People who are in any other sort of lifestyle, you know, let's say jocks or whatever.

709
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:46,830
Scott: They might enjoy role-playing games, but they don't play them because the themes of them are so nerdy.

710
00:48:46,950 --> 00:49:03,788
Scott: Well, there are many role-playing games out there which do not have such themes and if you don't even if you don't say You know the people that you're gonna play with that these are role-playing games or anything You can probably use these games to get people into role-playing who normally would not be.

711
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:19,950
Scott: but yeah basically there are a lot of people out there who recognize this problem that most RPGs tend to be nerdy and theme and they make Tiny simple easy to learn very cheap Role-playing games that you can play with your mom.

712
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:27,316
Scott: You could probably trick your mom and your brother and your dad and your whole family into playing these things and they'll have a good Time and they won't even know what they just did.

713
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:28,160
Rym: Yep.

714
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,412
Rym: In fact, the Wii has already done that with video gaming Yep.

715
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:33,862
Scott: Now one of these I think is pretty good.

716
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:34,926
Scott: You got inspectors.

717
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:35,870
Scott: That's a pretty good one.

718
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:46,170
Rym: Yeah, we've been playing inspectors not often but more than once lately Yep, and we're already thinking about how to modify it slightly to play much more serious game with it than it was probably intended for.

719
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,170
Scott: Yep, inspectors is basically like Ghostbusters the RPG.

720
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:54,025
Scott: So if people like Ghostbusters or whatever, then they'll probably like to play inspectors.

721
00:49:54,065 --> 00:49:59,124
Scott: Don't even tell them D&D Don't say role-playing just say, you know what just say.

722
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,690
Scott: hey, let's play this inspectors game.

723
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:08,230
Scott: I got you get some Six-sided dice and print out some pieces of paper and give everyone a copy of the book and you could probably get it going on.

724
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:13,929
Scott: Another one good one is primetime adventures, which is all about like TV type stuff people like TV.

725
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:18,114
Scott: you can get them to play primetime adventures and I'm not sure.

726
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:20,843
Scott: but besides us I get the feeling a lot of people like TV.

727
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:21,466
Scott: What do you think?

728
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,810
Scott: Ah, Possibly possibly possibly.

729
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:34,149
Scott: So yeah There are lots of independent RPGs out in the internets that you can find to get into if you're having a hard time finding Nerds to play the classics.

730
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:44,652
Rym: So just don't be put off by your possible image of what role-playing is and don't think that all Role-playing is nerds sitting around a table playing Dungeons & Dragons Cuz.

731
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,097
Scott: that's so far from the truth.

732
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:50,210
Rym: Yes now while we said a lot of that kind of role-playing is crap.

733
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:57,570
Rym: You know playing without story playing without characters just going through a dungeon crawl because a lot of people do that really poorly.

734
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:02,587
Rym: There is this other kind or this other style of role-playing that's pretty much 180 degrees around.

735
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:08,304
Rym: It's generally referred to as beer and pretzels D&D or beer and pretzels role-playing.

736
00:51:08,424 --> 00:51:11,817
Scott: Yes as in not serious We don't care about the story.

737
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:12,480
Scott: We're making.

738
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:14,510
Scott: let's just take this and have fun.

739
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:21,873
Rym: As in I got a flag and a beer I got a bag of pretzels and I'm gonna kill some orcs with my sword Awesome.

740
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:25,685
Scott: Yeah, basically this is nerd fun.

741
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:29,960
Scott: That is not so Deep intellectual interesting.

742
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:31,710
Rym: Yes, but it's still fun.

743
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:40,870
Rym: I mean, I'm not gonna deny that late at night at a convention Nothing's more fun than sitting around with a bunch of geeks playing some sort of high and mighty hack and slash.

744
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:50,930
Scott: Yeah, it basically, you know, you play D&D and you net good D&D Generally, you never get to the point where everyone's wicked powerful and slaying a bunch of monsters and all sorts of stuff.

745
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:55,336
Scott: It's it's always like we're like level four Maybe and it.

746
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:58,287
Scott: we don't have too many spells and everything sucks.

747
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:02,422
Scott: and it you know You don't get into that sort of fun, but a beer and pretzels game.

748
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:06,612
Scott: It's like I am the super night of Lord.

749
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:07,374
Rym: I am son.

750
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:09,199
Rym: You're God Akan.

751
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:09,640
Scott: Yes.

752
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:10,523
Scott: I am King.

753
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:14,403
Scott: testicles fear my mighty sword I slay with you.

754
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:26,039
Rym: Haha Now the thing is I still make the distinction between beer and pretzels D&D and bad D&D because beer and pretzels if run properly still avoids all the problems of bad D&D.

755
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:39,650
Rym: if you've got a DM who doesn't let the characters do anything or gets in their way constantly and is Adversarial and annoying and no matter what clever thing you come up with They just automatically make sure it doesn't work or they cheat with the die rolls to make sure they can't lose.

756
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,415
Rym: It's still bad D&D.

757
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:42,840
Rym: No matter how you slice it.

758
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:54,037
Scott: Yeah, I think the best example of beer and pretzels role-playing is that kobolds ate my baby game Which actually says on the bar on the book the beard pretzels role-playing game.

759
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:54,659
Rym: It pretty much is.

760
00:52:55,314 --> 00:52:59,354
Scott: Yeah It's a game where everyone's a kobold and you have to eat babies or rest.

761
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:01,180
Scott: take babies back to the kobold.

762
00:53:01,483 --> 00:53:02,659
Rym: Rescue is not the word.

763
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:05,367
Scott: Yes You go steal babies from the human.

764
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:12,846
Scott: perhaps them back to the kobold rescue them from life and deliver them into my belly perhaps and The game itself is silly.

765
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:17,380
Scott: you roleplay a little kobold and it's silly and everything is silly.

766
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:25,680
Scott: but you still left a roleplay this little furry kobold and it's still kind of fun and It's not as shallow as it first appears.

767
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,136
Scott: I mean you could play in a shallow bad manner where it's just a game of walk around the map.

768
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,128
Scott: collect the kobolds Like the babies.

769
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:41,993
Scott: Yeah, but that's Basically, the game is written so well that if you actually try to play it You're gonna end up role-playing this little kobold and it'll be beer and pretzels.

770
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,160
Scott: It won't be too serious, but it'll still be good.

771
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:49,959
Rym: So in some one not all role-playing is bad Dungeons & Dragons role-playing.

772
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,807
Rym: two Not all role-playing is Dungeons & Dragons.

773
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:57,380
Rym: Yeah, three not all role-playing is solely the realm of geeks and or nerds.

774
00:53:58,863 --> 00:53:59,611
Scott: Does that cover it?

775
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:00,319
Rym: I think so.

776
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:20,200
Rym: I mean beyond that the only advice we can give you is try to find a good group of people and more importantly if you find a group of People and you're not enjoying yourself and either they're not role-playing or it's not the kind of game you want to be in Or if you're not having fun, don't feel obligated to keep going quit find a different group.

777
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:24,378
Rym: You're better off not playing than playing a game that you don't enjoy going to.

778
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:25,964
Scott: yeah I know a lot of people have this.

779
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:32,760
Scott: problem is that they go to a game and they just feel obligated to keep going because They're in the game and if they leave then that game will be somehow ruined.

780
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:50,760
Rym: There was a game like that I won't mention who ran it at RIT that basically someone tricked me into joining it for the sole purpose of quitting without guilt and It was probably the worst Role-playing experience I have ever had more so than the guns game that I ran in high school.

781
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,640
Rym: Perhaps the worst role-playing experience I have ever inflicted upon others.

782
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,517
Scott: Yes, but yeah, don't feel bad about.

783
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:03,204
Scott: you know If you're in a bad role-playing game with with people who you know, like suck They think no bones about.

784
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:05,833
Scott: basically if you're role-playing and there's a problem.

785
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,040
Scott: You've got to open your mouth or move your feet.

786
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,804
Scott: That's pretty much.

787
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:10,534
Scott: you have to just do it immediately.

788
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:11,520
Scott: Don't hesitate at all.

789
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:19,500
Scott: Let's say I'm playing with a group of people and it's a good game But some of the people don't show up all the time and it's kind of hurting the game.

790
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:25,977
Scott: I basically the next time they show up I'd be like hey you guys don't show up if you're not gonna keep showing up Why don't we just stop this because it's not worth it.

791
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:37,527
Scott: or if We're role-playing and one of the characters just he's playing the stupid way and he's not saying anything or acting He's just rolling the dice doing the combat like hey Are you gonna roleplay?

792
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:38,715
Scott: or what are you doing here?

793
00:55:38,796 --> 00:55:39,260
Scott: Why are you here?

794
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:46,773
Scott: Maybe you should just leave, you know, if someone's being a problem and ruining your party say hey We're having fun Except you're ruining it.

795
00:55:46,894 --> 00:55:54,611
Scott: go home Yes, or if you're a role-playing with some people and they're all nerdy and you don't like it just say hey listen guys This isn't the kind of game that I like.

796
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:55,658
Scott: I'm not having fun here.

797
00:55:56,565 --> 00:56:03,380
Scott: We can either change it in this way Or I'm just gonna have to leave and find something else to do because this isn't fun for me.

798
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:11,380
Rym: I guess the real answer is if you haven't gone to college yet Go to college and you'll meet a bunch of people who roleplay and you'll probably find some good games.

799
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,020
Scott: And also do not hesitate to use local geeky shops and the internet to find people in your area.

800
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:24,660
Scott: There are probably a lot more people nearby Willing to roleplay than you think and even if you can only get together once a month or six times a year.

801
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:28,320
Scott: That's not too bad because you generally roleplay for hours on end.

802
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,620
Scott: Yeah, you'll still remember as long as the DM writes down what happened and gives a little recap.

803
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:33,804
Rym: I mean our current game.

804
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:40,670
Rym: we only play once a month and even that is being interrupted by things going on in our lives Yet mostly conventions and GeekNights.

805
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,380
Scott: yet the game still seems to be going strongly enough.

806
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,896
Scott: I don't feel like the game is weak or bad or anything.

807
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:50,860
Rym: Yep Now I guess any more we would say wouldn't really be how to get into role-playing.

808
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,192
Rym: It would be how to cause good role-playing which is a whole other show.

809
00:56:55,213 --> 00:57:06,348
Rym: Yep, and no point talk about that here This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
