00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,799

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,904
Rym: and now we're actually back from PAX.

6
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,727
Scott: How are we now?

7
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:32,070
Rym: No, we're not actually back.

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,122
Rym: We recorded like four weeks worth of shows the night before we flew out.

9
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:38,636
Scott: I actually know this is September 8th.

10
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:40,443
Rym: No, it's August 31st.

11
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,210
Rym: Yeah, we're recording like.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,690
Rym: Sure, all right Scott if this is the future then tell me what happened at PAX.

13
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:51,490
Scott: I'll tell you everything that happened at PAX in another episode.

14
00:00:52,156 --> 00:01:01,770
Scott: I don't really feel like it now But if I have to say one thing to prove that PAX happened I can say that the the final round of the Omega thon was the omega.

15
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,928
Scott: Yeah, okay Omega claw I win.

16
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:13,470
Rym: So for any of you who are new listeners You're wondering what's going on GeekNights is four different shows four nights a week.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,742
Rym: You know Mondays like science and neck beards and all that.

18
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,090
Rym: Tuesdays is what you want.

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,090
Rym: Tuesdays is your gaming, but you know, I ran into a lot of anime fans at PAX.

20
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:23,589
Rym: We saw three anime world order hoodies at PAX.

21
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:28,863
Scott: In fact during what I think one of them was the same guy twice But during one of our panels we were like hey who watches anime?

22
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:34,927
Scott: and a whole bunch of people raise their hand But they clearly they weren't hardcore anime fans because we said who is seen or heard of summer wars?

23
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,625
Rym: and almost nobody But a bunch of the enforcers really watched anime.

24
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:43,984
Rym: the good one of the cool guys I was talking to you after the late show was all about fist of the North Star.

25
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:44,626
Scott: No snap.

26
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:49,849
Scott: Yeah, so was Our recent interview Marcos Ove and is all about this the North Star.

27
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:54,966
Rym: It's kind of cool that you go to Otakon and like the people there are really not anime fans.

28
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:55,267
Rym: alert.

29
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,199
Rym: when I say Otakon I guess I use that to mean like any anime con.

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,130
Rym: a lot of people are not super into anime.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,870
Rym: They're kind of just there and into anime culture and they watch a little bit anime.

32
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:14,170
Rym: But all the random people I kind of talked to at PAX where anime came up They were just kind of casual anime fans and they'd seen way more anime than the average anime con attendee.

33
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,532
Scott: I think.

34
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:28,870
Scott: is they just seen more better anime because they're only watching the good stuff Whereas the so-called anime fans at the anime cons are watching tons of crap like Naruto and bleach which are tons and tons of episodes that are really terrible, but is there really tons of anime?

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,544
Rym: I mean, they're watching tons of individual episodes, but not tons of different shows.

36
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,247
Rym: That's true.

37
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:39,970
Scott: It's exactly right Whereas the more casual fans are watching only the really quality popular stuff or the stuff from their youth.

38
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,535
Scott: But they're watching all this.

39
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:46,190
Scott: good stuff such as you know goes in the shell movies and Miyazaki movies.

40
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:54,346
Rym: It was funny though At least some of the enforcers I was talking to in a gaggle on Saturday We're talking about how yeah, they were really into like Naruto and bleach and really?

41
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,230
Scott: Yeah, that's interesting.

42
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,343
Rym: But then they also had seen cowboy bebop.

43
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:03,510
Rym: it goes to the shell and all that All right, and remember we when I got into anime, I was watching Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon.

44
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,719
Rym: I did not of course when I really got into anime.

45
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,529
Rym: I watched vampire hunter D and project echo, but I did All right, yeah, I did both.

46
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:26,056
Rym: But the funny thing is of the anime world order hoodie people one of them And I didn't catch his name because we saw him like we were getting in the elevator Like Saturday night to go pass out and this guy's like walking by in the lobby like yo anime world order And he's like yo GeekNights.

47
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:26,578
Rym: What up?

48
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,990
Rym: I used to listen to you, but I disagreed with you about some anime.

49
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,970
Rym: So I stopped listening.

50
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:35,610
Scott: He was like yeah, I disagreed with you about some of the stuff you said, but he was totally friendly.

51
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:36,194
Scott: He wasn't like.

52
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,160
Scott: I hate you guys.

Scott: Thank you.

54
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:38,569
Scott: It's just like what's up?

55
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,984
Rym: I'm like oh all right, but I was like what you agree with.

56
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:41,970
Rym: let's talk about it.

57
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,503
Rym: He was like I don't want to talk about it.

58
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:44,210
Rym: See you later.

59
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,086
Scott: Yeah, I'm like all right.

62
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:56,348
Scott: I want to talk to him or Stop telling you're making your listeners hate us.

63
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,438
Rym: We got a cut to this person.

64
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,724
Scott: we don't make our listeners hate you.

65
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:00,507
Rym: we used to.

66
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:03,806

Rym: ever war War.

68
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,650
Scott: it'd be hard to get my top hat and monocle for war.

69
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,226
Rym: It'd be very difficult to have a war with those guys.

70
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:11,930
Rym: cuz what am I gonna say?

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,144

72
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:20,010

73
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,235
Scott: I will have to say that it.

74
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,070
Rym: I used to say it sucked a long time ago, but you know what I was wrong.

75
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:24,914
Rym: I was stupid.

76
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:25,617
Rym: I was young.

77
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:26,863
Rym: I didn't know what was up.

78
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:27,768
Scott: Well.

79
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:28,210
Scott: It doesn't matter.

80
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,543
Scott: There's no point having a war with someone who is already dead.

81
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:35,236
Rym: I Must be causing so much trouble for Emily.

82
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,985
Rym: she every time anyone who speaks Japanese is around.

83
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,450
Rym: you know cuz she speaks Japanese.

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,135
Rym: She hangs out with people who speak Japanese.

85
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:49,095
Rym: I pretty much cannot stop myself from saying oh my wah moh shindeiru or at least being like I Don't know.

86
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:49,580
Rym: I'm weird.

87
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:50,509
Scott: Why do you do that?

88
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:54,382
Scott: I just do you think you need to eject the Stan Lee from your body.

89
00:04:54,402 --> 00:05:00,301
Scott: I'm not bolding when I say oh my It's equally corny in fact perhaps even more corn.

90
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:00,983
Scott: is it really corny?

91
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,409
Scott: or is it mean even Stan Lee?

92
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,825
Scott: well He'll say things like Excelsior or you know stuff like that or you know.

93
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,190
Rym: see I don't think it's corny.

94
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,089
Rym: I will argue that what I do is just weird.

95
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,792
Scott: It's corny.

96
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,878
Rym: now corny is this whole different level.

97
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:14,580
Scott: it makes it.

98
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,910
Scott: it causes everyone near you to groan in pain.

99
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,732
Scott: Therefore you should not do it Everyone.

100
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,379
Scott: just oh god stop it.

101
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,102
Rym: That's just.

102
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,090
Rym: I was trying to buy some anime on the Amazon.

103
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,300
Scott: Well, why were you buying anime on the Amazon?

104
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,189
Scott: is it not at the anime you wanted not on Netflix?

105
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,510
Rym: Netflix is dub only it's not on crunchyroll.

106
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:34,954
Rym: Actually, no.

107
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:35,920
Rym: It's not on crunchyroll.

108
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,207
Scott: Is it anyone where it's a?

109
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,298
Scott: what anime Did you want that you had to get on DVD?

110
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,730
Rym: well Emily has never seen try gun what?

111
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:43,713
Rym: Yeah, which is?

112
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:48,068
Rym: that's probably the only gap in her anime watching experience.

113
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,574
Rym: at this point I mean mm-hmm.

114
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:53,508
Rym: she she's into anime as much as we are and that's the only show I can think of.

115
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:57,030
Scott: try gun was one Of my favorite shows when I first saw is still one of my favorite shows.

116
00:05:58,214 --> 00:05:59,759
Scott: I never got the whole box.

117
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,769
Scott: I think I only bought the final DVD for some because we had to watch the.

118
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:14,043
Scott: But anyway the We never got the full box set because it was always like a zillion dollars And it never got cheap, and they never made a thin pass.

119
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:14,868
Rym: so it got re-released.

120
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,330
Rym: It's like $32.

121
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,953
Rym: oh Three order.

Rym: so 32 bucks.

Rym: No shipping basically no sales tax.

125
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:36,250
Rym: This is why anime con dealers do not get my money anymore because I in the last like three years you walk in there you Look at the box set on the table like the $5 bin, and I'm like all right.

126
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,398
Rym: Here's a box set for five bucks.

127
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,003
Rym: I go to Amazon $3.99.

128
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:40,585
Rym: use no shipping.

129
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:48,626
Rym: all right great It'll be sent to my house at the carrot home Came to a sad revelation because I was like oh, yeah, and I pre-order try gun.

130
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:52,656
Scott: like nobody's business I can just tap a few buttons on my phone And I have 32 bucks pre-ordered.

131
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,177
Rym: good to go.

132
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,512
Rym: and then it you know after I pre-order it recommends at the bottom like you might Also like these.

133
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:58,916
Rym: and I saw gunkatsu.

134
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:03,770
Rym: Oh a show that I really liked like if try gun is an a anime gunkatsu.

135
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,795
Rym: Oh, it was like a b-plus.

136
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:07,046
Rym: It only doesn't get the a because the ending was bullshit.

137
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,374
Scott: mm-hmm I don't think.

138
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,936
Scott: actually I think I saw most of the show But I don't think I saw the end.

139
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:13,150
Rym: oh good basically watch up to that climax.

140
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,150
Rym: You know the really awesome client with the robot fight.

141
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,056
Scott: Yeah, I saw that.

142
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:18,290
Rym: and then the denim all like right after the robot fight.

143
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,505
Scott: I think I saw one or two episodes after and after.

144
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:25,745
Rym: you know Albert and everybody like everything kind of gets on and everybody's having their like badminton moment.

145
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:29,596
Rym: Just don't watch anymore Cuz the end is really fucking.

146
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,101
Scott: so just stop at the salad days.

147
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,285
Rym: the end is yeah salad days.

148
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,766
Rym: beyond that everything's really fucking stupid And nobody's up for tennis, okay?

149
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,877
Rym: So in front oh That was a good show.

150
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:41,142
Rym: maybe I should buy it.

151
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:41,423
Rym: it was.

152
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:45,706
Rym: I wouldn't mind showing that to someone else Maybe watch it again, and then I looked and it was like 13 bucks.

153
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:52,804
Rym: That's a really good price for the whole show, but then I thought about it And I realized that 13 bucks is really not worth it.

154
00:07:52,824 --> 00:08:00,910
Rym: cuz at that point The space that those DVDs take up in my apartment is almost not worth owning the show because maybe I'll watch it again once ever.

155
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:05,586
Rym: Maybe I'll lend it to someone once or twice, but that's really it.

156
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,730
Rym: I can't think of anyone.

157
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,299
Rym: I know I'm gonna lend gonkotsuo to that.

158
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,319
Rym: I don't already have to lend like bebop Ava, Eska, Trigon Eska flow.

159
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,168
Scott: if it was if it was $13 right for like it's like 50 cents an episode for HD downloads that were free of DRM.

160
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:21,870
Scott: I might have bought it.

161
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,801
Scott: I would have bought that yeah, but for DVDs.

162
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,010
Scott: It's like I don't want these DVDs taking up room in my house.

163
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:37,770
Scott: Also, I heard from reliable source that there were extras on the original DVDs and that thin case Does not have the because I wanted to fit it on for DVDs, but who cares about the extras?

164
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,034
Scott: What do you need extras for?

165
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:42,750
Rym: the extras are supposed to be awesome like a new town where they had all that useless bullshit.

166
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:48,070
Scott: The only extras in any DVD I've ever wanted were the South Park and also Futurama.

167
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:55,058
Rym: I did enjoy some of the commentary and the interviews on the ghost in the shell But there was all like original Japanese extras.

168
00:08:55,078 --> 00:09:00,338
Rym: a lot of these DVDs have like American extras that just suck Or they have just the art gallery only.

169
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:08,890
Scott: the only things I ever want to see are really short And really insightful commentaries by the actual creators of the thing not by some American voice actors or adapters.

170
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,920
Rym: Hey to be fair the full commentary track to these had.

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,846
Rym: a movie is worth it just to hear him being like.

172
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:24,840
Scott: I Really like that sort of thing, but I also want to see Deleted scenes and that sort of stuff because even though I know deleted scenes are deleted for a reason because they suck It's still.

173
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:39,785
Scott: they're still interesting Yeah, and the other oh, there's actually one other kind of extra that is good, and that is the omak a kind of thing for Example Minnie Pato or lotus island lotus island or What's on the the Hypno toad.

174
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:43,057
Rym: oh Was that really extra?

175
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,184
Rym: that was a full episode of course, that's.

176
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,166
Scott: that's why that's what.

177
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,350
Scott: that's what an omak a is.

178
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:55,070
Scott: It's actually extra Actual real content that's on there not some addendum sort of half content like a commentary.

179
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,034
Scott: It's an actual.

180
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:59,649
Scott: hey look you buy this DVD you get an actual extra episode sort of like.

181
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:10,550
Scott: you know They do that in comic sometimes like buy this comic and guess what there's actually another comic in it an Actual real comic not just like a page of something or an ad an actual extra comic free.

182
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,908
Scott: So when you buy you know that's a real extra whatever All right.

183
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:26,670
Scott: So yeah So that the reason that gun could sue it was so cheap is because apparently there's this funimation save Program sa ve and they're selling save anime or save money.

184
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,500
Rym: I think it's save money because it's not save anime.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,198
Rym: cuz the thing I've seen in the anime community lately is oh my god Bye DVDs.

186
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,330
Rym: We're all going out of business.

187
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,828
Scott: Well, it definitely saves the customer money because they have all these anime series for like 15 bucks.

188
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,279
Rym: I'm not paying 15 bucks.

189
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,806
Rym: I don't need the anime.

190
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:43,670
Rym: This is where they fail.

191
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:47,310
Scott: Well the thing is I went down the list and I looked at every single one of the shows.

192
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,942
Scott: I was like nope nope nope nope nope except for one and I bought it.

193
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:51,765
Rym: What show was that?

194
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,150
Scott: galaxy railway?

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,617
Rym: But you know what I. you know what I found out.

196
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,010
Scott: you find out there's actually galaxy railways too, and they don't have that.

197
00:10:59,092 --> 00:10:59,789
Scott: It's unlicensed.

198
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:05,050
Scott: So this is galaxy railways one only which is which is a full series.

199
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,384
Rym: I considered though buying Eden of the East.

200
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:08,310
Rym: there's like 30 bucks.

201
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,868
Rym: But I kind of just want to watch it, and I don't want I read it.

202
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,058
Scott: I was really I watched it all already.

203
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:13,982
Rym: is it worth buying?

204
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,488
Rym: is it worth watching again ever?

205
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,235
Scott: I would watch it again.

206
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:18,781
Scott: Maybe in a few years.

207
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,089
Scott: Maybe but I wouldn't buy it yeah.

208
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:27,782
Scott: So I also bought that book Rules of play that Luke crane is always talking about.

209
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,425
Rym: oh wait wait wait.

210
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,290
Rym: so not anime stuff.

211
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,798
Rym: We're talking about not anime stuff for buying.

212
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:33,130
Rym: I wanted like a board gaming orgasm spree.

213
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:33,854
Scott: What'd you buy?

214
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:34,398
Scott: an Amazon?

215
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,525
Rym: well cuz we were just at PAX.

216
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,370
Rym: I bought modern art.

217
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:39,269
Rym: It was like 20 bucks, and that was a fun game to whip out mm-hmm.

218
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,223
Rym: I bought Zula right oh cuz it was 20 bucks.

219
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,029
Rym: It was a fun game.

220
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:49,349
Rym: I bought Bonanza cuz that's a fucking awesome game And it was like 20 bucks mm-hmm, and I got the second Locke Lamora book cuz it was super cheap.

221
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,514
Scott: Already had that book.

222
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:51,718
Rym: yeah, I didn't have it.

223
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,179
Rym: I got lost.

224
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,487
Rym: cities cuz that game is pretty good.

225
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,042
Rym: I hear yeah It was like 15, but it's a two people game, which is rare.

226
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,690
Rym: I also finally got some headphones.

227
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:00,915
Scott: Oh, which can?

228
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:04,811
Rym: some Panasonic like retro looking pink ones pink ones It's.

229
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:12,082
Scott: the pink ones were like $30 cheaper than the identical black ones Uh-huh, but to get some pics for the people who will love that.

230
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:13,005
Rym: I think they're pretty cool.

231
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,656
Rym: I'm gonna be a headphone Musume I also bought.

232
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,585
Scott: I have a new strategy for the book club.

233
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:23,105
Scott: I bought the next book club book But you're not gonna say I won't say it on the show until it's time.

234
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,190
Rym: It's not time yet.

235
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:25,509
Scott: No, I have a new strategy.

236
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,953
Scott: I don't even.

237
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,090
Scott: the thing is I don't even know if it'll be a good book.

238
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,905
Scott: I actually might be a bad book, but I think it will get people to read.

239
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:39,069
Rym: so huh That's tantalizing because get people to read only means one of two things at least from your perspective.

240
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,282
Rym: one It's a children's book or two.

241
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,550
Rym: it is controversial.

242
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,028
Scott: Neither one really yeah, huh?

243
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,255
Scott: Third I did buy something.

244
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,001
Rym: I think you really are gonna want.

245
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,550
Rym: but I got the ultra rare cocoa bean.

246
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,590
Scott: So I guess we should do news, but there is no news or at least there's no news that I care about.

247
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:06,751
Rym: I mean right stuff said that they're not gonna carry urban visions catalog anymore, but I can't think of what is urban vision have I don't.

248
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:12,086
Rym: they can't think of anything they have since like gogo 13 or ninja scroll.

249
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:13,049
Rym: I got like nothing.

250
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,480
Scott: so I want to do a geek bite.

251
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:19,631
Scott: Geek bite Bye ultra rare geek bite the.

252
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:29,506
Scott: so I got Scott's box right before packs and I talked about this on there, but it was so awesome And I read the whole thing that now I have to talk about it.

253
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:34,077
Scott: on GeekNights I got this trade paperback called strange tales.

254
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:48,675
Scott: It's a Marvel comic and There was a strange tale series back in the day right, but this is a new strange tale series right and Basically in this trade paperback you get the whole it's.

255
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:52,274
Scott: there was three issues Originally, and you get all three issues in this one trade.

256
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,460
Scott: It's totally awesome.

257
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,925
Scott: Now what is strange tale?

258
00:13:55,945 --> 00:14:16,948
Scott: so basically what they did is Marvel believe it or not went out, and they got some of the best Non Marvel indie comic creators that are out there and they had each of them do really tiny Marvel comics like a few pages like a page or two maybe you know something like that and They put them all together in this one book.

259
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:20,600
Scott: and let me tell you this book is so awesome like unbelievably awesome.

260
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,675
Scott: Let me just give you some of the names of people that made stuff in this book.

261
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,116

00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:41,173
Scott: You got Nick Gurwitch.

266
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:45,287
Scott: You know that is Probably bowel fellowship Nick Gurwitch.

267
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:46,492
Rym: He's an important man.

268
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,298
Rym: Yeah, what if that's updated?

269
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,660

Rym: oh man wait Jason doing spider-man.

275
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,055
Rym: I picture us a forlorn looking spider-man standing there.

276
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,763
Rym: It's all cool It's.

277
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:08,507
Scott: it's totally.

278
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:09,994

Rym: I'm all about this.

284
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:26,619
Rym: his book is totally sweet enough to borrow it and perhaps read it.

285
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:42,860
Scott: Everybody should go out to Amazon and buy Strange tales the trade paperback from Marvel Comics, you know what they're now they're doing strange tales max Which is gonna be all more hardcore, and you know dark and for serious than regular strange tales.

286
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,902
Scott: So it's gonna be totally sweet.

287
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,369
Rym: so things of the day.

288
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,210
Rym: What do you got for me?

289
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:08,206
Scott: So we were at packs PAX West 2010. right and many things happen there But we can't talk about them because then what we talk about when we do the pack show and this show will become full of packs talk and we come the pack show.

290
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,770
Scott: So but that does not mean I cannot steal a thing of the day from packs.

291
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,449
Scott: And you know I'm probably gonna steal a bunch of things of the day from packs because I need some things of the day.

292
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,098
Scott: So here is a thing that happened at packs.

293
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:27,179
Scott: that was I guess indirectly our fault that it happened But I was not present at the time, but luckily it is on the youtubes.

294
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,990
Scott: in This video you see the man John st.

295
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:43,785
Scott: John balls of steel in the magfest sponsored JAM space and He is singing the song that is known as free bird In its entirety.

296
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,458
Rym: so you got to admit it was pretty great at the omega-thon finale.

297
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:48,843
Rym: when they're like Can you guess the game?

298
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,616
Rym: and that one guy yelled above everybody else free bird.

299
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,539
Scott: that was a great guy?

300
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,960
Scott: But yeah, here's this video for your entertainment.

301
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,360
Rym: Alright, so I for once do not have a video.

302
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,040
Rym: I was gonna do that synchronized walking on College Humor from Japan because typical Wednesday thing of the day fodder.

303
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,000
Rym: But instead I have an article that I don't have any commentary about so I figure I'll link to it.

304
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,497
Rym: This is my thing of the day, but then I don't have to talk about it.

305
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:20,339
Rym: It's by W to Arudo who seems to write somewhat inflammatory articles for the Japanese or the Japan Times.

306
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,400
Scott: So it says a Japanese troll not troll.

307
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,175
Rym: They're inflammatory, but they're very observational and correct like this is most recent one before.

308
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,889
Rym: this talks about how in Japan There's super racism against non-japanese people in hostels.

309
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,918
Rym: And if you're not Japanese, they pretty much won't let you stay in hostels.

310
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,460
Scott: That's true?

311
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,440
Rym: Yes, so this sounds true?

312
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:45,459
Rym: I don't know talks about the jet program and The fact that the Japanese people by and large speak English worse than any other people in the world.

313
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,827
Scott: You know, they do.

314
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:54,714
Rym: they pronounce things pretty poorly But they you know they have perfect grammar and he talks about that in extensive detail.

315
00:17:54,755 --> 00:18:07,818
Rym: as to why he thinks that is and the He gets really into this stuff about the culture of the classroom and what programs like jet really do and what happens when you get Fluent English speaker in a classroom after the kind of tutelage that they get in Japan about English.

316
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:16,480
Rym: up to that point He basically says they teach English the way they teach Latin in America Mmm, and he makes really interesting points and it's a really good read.

317
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:24,392
Rym: But I didn't really feel like commenting on it on the show other than getting you to read it All righty, and if you want to read about Japan and stuff that is kind of fucked up.

318
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:26,520
Rym: W tell Ardo is the way to go.

319
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,899
Scott: Yeah, I just you know, I worry because it sounds like almost this is like a Fox News person of Japan almost, you know.

320
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:40,191
Rym: So I wonder and without further ado, I guess it's time for the meta Moment, let's keep the meta moment kind of short.

321
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,060
Rym: here almost everything we care about is done.

322
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,352
Rym: We got the New York Anime Festival New York comic-con coming up.

323
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,519

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,324
Rym: We'll be there same.

Scott: let me check my calendar here.

328
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,360
Rym: I thought you wanted to keep it quick and then you're like delay.

329
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:05,238
Scott: October 8th is also a board game night as is this nerd NYC board game night.

Rym: And Do we did many years ago?

341
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,547
Rym: We did the entire first half of the show talking like pirates.

Scott: now September 25th and 26th is the New York City World Maker Faire Surprisingly shame general location as the new World Fair without the word maker in the middle.

00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:03,504
Scott: Yep.

Rym: So read it.

348
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:11,800
Rym: Yeah, it's short.

349
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:15,435
Rym: It's like twenty two to four page short stories.

350
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:16,480
Rym: It's not that hard.

351
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,874
Scott: Is there any other meta stuff we have to cover?

352
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,200
Scott: if there is we'll cover it later.

353
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:22,905
Scott: That's the end of that moment.

354
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,240
Rym: That was not prepared at all and kind of crappy what?

355
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,845
Rym: Yeah, and this day.

356
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:30,170
Rym: Let me look up the date.

357
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,199
Rym: We're doing something cuz I was looking at the wrong thing No one cares about unless they live in New York.

358
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,063
Scott: We got it.

359
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:41,140
Scott: We need to get like the non New York convention schedule, you know.

360
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,660
Scott: So we can tell like the next, you know relatively major anime gaming comic conventions that are.

361
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,025
Rym: Anybody cares about that stuff?

362
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,671
Rym: probably already knows.

363
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,920
Scott: you'd be surprised how many people like that.

364
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,478
Scott: You know they they'll post even in our forums which means they're paying attention to the world.

365
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:02,219
Scott: a Convention happens near them and they don't find out until after true or even like I remember it nerd NYC.

366
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,474
Rym: You know super hardcore gamers and a bunch of them.

367
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:10,258
Rym: They never heard of packs Penny arcade and yet they're like super video game super board game.

368
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,719
Rym: Yep It happens and it's not like they don't like penny arcades like they'd never even heard of it.

369
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,940
Scott: Yep, so we should get like a list of you know cons that are relatively big.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Scott: I don't want to talk about like the Holiday Inn guy shows up selling some comics in a box.

371
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,936
Rym: Oh, you mean like that comic con in Wildwood that we go to but it's not a con.

372
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,498
Scott: It's just a.

373
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,080
Rym: it's a con.

374
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,883
Scott: It's not a con.

375
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:30,425
Scott: It's a sales.

376
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:31,589
Rym: It's a convention.

377
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:32,211
Scott: It's not.

378
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,134
Rym: it is a convention.

379
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:33,777
Scott: No, it's not.

380
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:38,190
Scott: Yes, it is Definition of convention needs to have events to be a convention.

381
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,852
Rym: No, it doesn't.

382
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:39,133
Rym: Yes.

383
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,357
Rym: Just a dealer's room counts.

384
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:41,140
Scott: No, it's not.

385
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,631
Scott: So then the malls a convention.

386
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:47,105
Scott: No, okay, that's permanent So any temporary.

387
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:50,075
Scott: so flee it's a flea market is yeah, basically flea market convention.

388
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:51,360
Rym: Basically the same thing.

389
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,060
Scott: No, a flea market is not a convention.

390
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,048
Rym: I would argue that they are in fact the same thing.

391
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:57,820
Scott: a flea market would have to have a scheduled events to be a convention.

392
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:00,359
Rym: However, I would argue that many conventions do have fleas.

393
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:01,565
Scott: That is true.

394
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:09,716
Rym: so when you know, we're talking about a Hypno toad as an extra and We actually watch and when I say we I mean me and Scott the entire front row crew.

395
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:15,920
Rym: for any new listeners who missed this Old episode we watched the entire episode of Hypno toad that was on that one future.

396
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,101
Rym: I'm.

397
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:19,596
Scott: a thing is I don't remember if anything happened stuff at the end or not.

398
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:20,660
Rym: quite a bit happened.

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,346
Scott: In fact, I don't remember.

400
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:24,394
Rym: we watch as a group the entire thing.

401
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,900
Rym: No one got bored known when did anything.

402
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,845
Scott: In fact, we were bored.

403
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,614
Rym: I don't think anyone looked away from the screen.

404
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:29,820
Scott: I looked away.

405
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,936
Rym: serotonin problem from the Hobbit joke.

406
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:49,859
Rym: But future Amma animation one of the more important beloved well-known well-loved beloved Cartoons to ever be shown on American television very popular worldwide even and it's Wednesday and we've never talked about it.

407
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,833
Scott: Yeah, I mean we're like every I've been.

408
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:56,437
Scott: I watched a whole bunch of animes But Rym really hasn't and I read a whole bunch of comics.

409
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,951
Scott: but Rym I'm watching fist of the North Star and I'm watching already finish that.

410
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,640
Scott: Yeah, I already finished that more almost finished with that one.

411
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,446
Scott: So I'm just way out of you.

412
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,891
Scott: So yeah, that's a problem.

413
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:06,895
Rym: I've been reading books.

414
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,059
Scott: I also been reading books.

415
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,787
Scott: You have also not been shit-talking.

416
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,734
Scott: Do you just way behind on everything?

417
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,220
Rym: I've been actually working on shit.

418
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,232
Rym: Talk to you quite a bit.

419
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,970
Scott: All right Well, we'll see when I will see when I see some shit.

420
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:19,840
Rym: cuz Pax was our last big thing.

421
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:26,420
Scott: The next important thing we have to do is Pax When I see some when I see some poop, I'll believe that you're not shit talking.

422
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:27,724
Scott: There you go.

423
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:28,730
Scott: All right.

424
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:34,292
Scott: So yeah, so I said hey Let's see Futurama's animation and we've never done a show about that.

425
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,340
Scott: And you know what people probably really like a show on that.

426
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,387
Scott: So let's do a show on that.

427
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,393
Rym: Wait, this opens the door.

428
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:39,420
Rym: We could do a show on the Simpsons.

429
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,906
Rym: Yeah, we could do a show on South Park.

430
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:42,589
Rym: Why Futurama?

431
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,134
Rym: Why is Futurama different from the Simpsons?

432
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:47,672
Rym: They're both still going They're both wildly popular.

433
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,120
Rym: They're both good.

434
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:54,900
Scott: Well, I think the thing with Futurama is that it has so much more nerd cred and it's much more appropriate for GeekNights.

435
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:07,660
Scott: Cuz you know, first of all, it is all sci-fi II right and has a future spacey theme large numbers of surprisingly subtle physics Jokes, yeah, and you know, the Simpsons has jokes all over the place too like that, you know.

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,279
Scott: And it has plenty of geek cred as well.

437
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,215
Scott: You know, you're not gonna go in a comic store without seeing some Simpsons stuff.

438
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,243
Scott: You got Simpsons comics You got comic book guy.

439
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:19,500
Scott: There's plenty of nerd jokes, you know, Alan Moore was on the Simpsons and in a guest appearance, right?

440
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,879
Scott: There's plenty of nerd cred going on there.

441
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,767
Scott: But I think you know, the Futurama is just a little bit more nerdy And I think it's really nerds that are propping it up.

442
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:28,791
Scott: right because it came.

443
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:31,340
Scott: it didn't really get the TV ratings.

444
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:35,200
Scott: It went away, but then the nerds sort of kept it alive.

445
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,920
Rym: It's one of the only times the nerds who wanted something to come back actually got what they wanted.

446
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,291
Rym: I mean, how much did people lose their shit about Firefly?

447
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:43,154
Rym: Oh my god.

448
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:45,100
Rym: We got a fight to bring Firefly back.

449
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:45,822
Rym: It's gonna cut.

450
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:46,826
Rym: it's never coming back.

451
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:55,100
Scott: I Have a. There are a few loud fans.

452
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:03,486
Scott: The number of fans isn't actually that large just seems larger than it is because there's a few loud ones and not only are they Loud but they're extra dedicated.

453
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:04,350
Scott: It's even an event.

454
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,239
Scott: They all show up and pack the house.

455
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,439
Scott: We have a service and you have a Simpsons event.

456
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:17,025
Scott: There's got to be a hundred times more Simpsons fans than Firefly fans, but if you have an event those people who are Simpsons fans They just watch it every Sunday.

457
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:17,326
Scott: They don't.

458
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:18,471
Scott: it's not their lives.

459
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,700
Scott: You know, they don't live and breathe Simpsons.

460
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,399
Scott: There's only so many people who do that.

461
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:29,940
Scott: So they're not gonna show up in droves and scream on the internet if there's a Simpsons event or a Simpsons thing or whatever.

462
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,839
Scott: You know, there's only some people who will do that.

463
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:39,600
Rym: So really I think wide future Alma's relevant is that you know The Simpsons is still going but I watched a whole bunch of episodes of it in the last few weeks.

464
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,848
Rym: It's really not that funny anymore at all.

465
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,339
Rym: It's really kind of mainstream and kind of Mainstream and lame do not necessarily mean the same thing.

466
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:54,306
Rym: But the Simpsons is really just kind of these like obvious Ham-fisted pop-culture jokes.

467
00:25:54,747 --> 00:26:00,064
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the main thing is that when you do the pop-culture jokes, you know You're really sort of like.

468
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:04,380
Scott: it's not enjoyable to anyone who doesn't isn't a person who was in pop.

469
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,469
Rym: I'll get old Simpsons like Willie, you know the shinning.

470
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,997
Rym: that was mostly kind of timeless jokes.

471
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:10,980
Rym: You can watch the episode today.

472
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,699
Rym: It's just as funny.

473
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,746
Scott: Well, that's because it was.

474
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,220
Scott: it was still a pop-culture reference to the shinning.

475
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Rym: It was a pop-culture reference to what was itself a timeless thing exactly what I was about to say, you know.

476
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:29,920
Scott: So if you make if you look at like old Looney Tunes Episodes right the ones that hold up are the ones that just have generic jokes like, you know, rabbit season duck season, right?

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,940
Scott: But the ones that are like where they're impersonating famous people of the time like, you know, Jack Benny.

478
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,511
Rym: I would argue that those still work.

479
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:40,439
Scott: for example they work But they don't work on people who don't know who those famous people were.

480
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:48,487
Rym: But the Groucho Marx ones definitely work because I think a lot of people think that that kind of character is Bugs Bunny and don't Realize that there was a Groucho Marx.

481
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,235
Scott: Yeah, I think that that worries me.

482
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,520
Rym: or Rodney Dangerfield?

483
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,319
Rym: I think people think that is a character, but don't know Rodney Dangerfield is.

484
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,408
Scott: Yeah, but you know the point is What's his name are?

485
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,786
Scott: Yes Peter Laurie.

486
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,378
Rym: Yeah, Peter Laurie or how about?

487
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:04,904
Rym: I don't know who that is.

488
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:05,807
Rym: You don't know that guy is.

489
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:06,128
Rym: Yeah.

490
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,140
Rym: He's the the hotel manager in the hotel broken arms.

491
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,716
Rym: Fame is famous actor and voice actor.

492
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,564
Rym: All right I can't do it.

493
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:22,670
Rym: Okay voice is still kind of shot from packs, but future Amma is Mostly with the exception of that iPhone episode.

494
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,975
Rym: They just did pretty timeless.

495
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,300
Rym: I think yeah.

496
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:30,400
Scott: And the other thing is that the characters are just so much, you know, like the the variety in there.

497
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:37,410
Scott: you got so much, you know, each one is more exaggerated and Has more shtick going on right?

498
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,400
Scott: Whereas the simp - whereas the Simpsons.

499
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:45,460
Scott: It's like, you know, they have just this huge cast right where each one does a little bit first notice how.

500
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,765
Rym: that's a recent phenomenon.

501
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:47,809
Rym: the Simpsons had.

502
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:49,516
Rym: you know the core and they're all the urban.

503
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:52,509
Rym: look at the early eras of the Simpsons you basically define them by.

504
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,719
Rym: was it about Bart or was it about Homer?

505
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,284
Rym: and then you defined it by.

506
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,876
Rym: was it when Homer was stupid when he was evil when he was cunning?

507
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:05,459
Rym: all these eras of the Simpsons and Every now and then they give like Moe would have an episode and then they kind of ran out of stuff to do.

508
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,900
Rym: and I Feel like now like half the episodes are about Moe.

509
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,970
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know anymore it's always Moe.

510
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,860
Scott: but in future in Futurama they have core characters.

511
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,064
Scott: They've brought a few in.

512
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:19,760
Scott: you know, like zap Brannigan became more important and I guess I love that brand the green.

513
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:20,537
Scott: What's the green guy?

514
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,229
Scott: The alien kiff.

515
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,118
Scott: Yeah, he became more important, right?

516
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:36,974
Scott: But and you know, but other than that, you know, most of the characters who were side characters like, you know Nixon and scruffy and hedonism, but they maintain like the right level.

517
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,740
Scott: They maintain their sideness.

518
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,605
Scott: There isn't a hedonism bought episode But they're still strong.

519
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,520
Rym: a hedonism bought episode would I think harken the end of future?

520
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,640
Scott: I would be a shark jumpage even though he doesn't bust up.

521
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,298
Scott: I love he doesn't buy but it would be a shark jump, but it's the same thing.

522
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:53,858
Rym: every Oh most his lack was my favorite character in the Simpsons just because of two knives.

523
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:58,340
Rym: Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, but then now like there's a Moe episode and I just don't care.

524
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,766
Scott: Yeah, the thing is in Futurama.

525
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:09,789
Scott: every episode what focus is usually on one of the core characters is oidberg or Amy right or fry or something like that.

526
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,226
Scott: and then the other characters all the main ones are all in there Constantly, you know.

527
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:15,955
Scott: and the side characters they all.

528
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:16,920
Scott: they remain side.

529
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,539
Scott: They'll show up for like one second in the episode and be gone.

530
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,851
Rym: I've I've noticed something to the kind of talking about like and they can keep.

531
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:28,432
Scott: they can keep cranking the episodes and they still work Even though they're keeping the focus on the main crew.

532
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,637
Rym: think about nerd culture.

533
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:36,209
Rym: when you were in high school You know back when the Simpsons was still, you know The old kind of Simpsons and even early college People would collect Simpsons.

534
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,121
Rym: quoting was kind of like the nerd thing to do Like.

535
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:41,796
Rym: you'd always make the Simpsons reference in concert conversation.

536
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:42,438
Rym: It would just come up.

537
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:45,749
Rym: You mostly hear the Futurama references around nerds.

538
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,920
Rym: You don't hear that many Simpsons references and if you do it's always old Simpsons.

539
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,019
Rym: Mmm, that's true.

540
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,471
Rym: I feel like Futurama is the mantle of like.

541
00:29:52,853 --> 00:30:01,705
Rym: that is the nerd cartoon And I guess the only other cartoon as he referenced a lot are like Venture Brothers or Archer South Park.

542
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,191
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

543
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:12,757
Rym: plus name the good popular Cartoons that are on TV or were recently on TV in America that weren't animes.

544
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:13,720
Rym: there were an anime.

545
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,505
Rym: There's an animation cartoons Futurama South Park.

546
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:20,336
Rym: Yeah, and I would argue Archer you didn't watch Archer.

547
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:22,343
Rym: but Archer is fucking hilarious Whatever.

548
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:26,478
Rym: and I think a lot of people are quoting Archer and you just don't notice because you don't you didn't watch it.

549
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:38,460
Scott: It is very likely that many people quote things and I have no idea that they're quoting something because I did not watch the thing That they're quoting much like someone watching a non timeless Simpsons episode with pop culture references.

550
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,329
Rym: Yeah, the Simpsons kind of went the Shrek route.

551
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,253
Rym: I mean Shrek was.

552
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,740
Rym: it's all just pop culture.

553
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,493
Rym: That won't make any sense ten years from now.

554
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:50,019
Rym: Yep Of course, I worry that there's going to be a day when no one knows what the Shannon was.

555
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,077
Scott: There are people already who don't know what the shitting is.

556
00:30:53,158 --> 00:31:02,454
Rym: I know I mean the fact that we'll go to an anime con and we're like how many people haven't seen cowboy bebop like half the crowd Raised their hands and then we're like how many people haven't seen Star Wars.

557
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:03,980
Rym: about half the crowd raised their hands.

558
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,770
Scott: There were people who raised their hand.

559
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:06,594
Scott: Yeah, and they were.

560
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,971
Rym: there are many gasps But there'll be a day when the gasps is.

561
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:14,171
Rym: you've seen Star Wars Which I mean look at this.

562
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:20,897
Rym: every Pax we have been to has the focal point of the keynote not been Star Wars changed everything.

563
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:28,874
Scott: every single Pax keynote speaker always Mentions and makes a big deal out of how Star Wars changed everything in their lives.

564
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:34,615
Rym: anime to every anime director We ever see in person is like yeah Star Wars fucking changed everything for me.

565
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,020
Scott: But meanwhile, right?

566
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,753
Scott: It's so disappointing at George Lucas is a piece of shit right now.

567
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:40,415
Rym: No, he's not.

568
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:42,743
Rym: you know, what happened there Means a sad story.

569
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:47,200
Rym: He was a great director and then his neck killed him and continued making movies.

570
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,496
Scott: The thing is he didn't even direct Empire Strikes Back Jedi.

571
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,740
Scott: He gets all this credit mean, you know.

572
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,680
Rym: Well, it's kind of like M Night Shyamalan who unfortunately died before he can make the Avatar movie.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,567
Rym: I was looking forward to.

574
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:06,964
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, it's like The like who you know every other awesome Thing that is huge.

575
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:07,847
Rym: Well, look at the difference.

576
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,172
Scott: The person is also awesome.

577
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:10,315
Rym: Here's a big contrast.

578
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,580
Rym: So we've got Lucas, right?

579
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:19,163
Rym: There was a happy accident that all the people around him were amazingly competent and this awesome work came out and he's kind of a mediocre You know director.

580
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:24,157
Rym: all things considered meanwhile, I look at Soshi Khan who wrote and directed like everything.

581
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,837
Scott: Yep Yeah Anyway, why couldn't they take Lucas's thing?

582
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:36,956
Rym: Anymore so Futurama is just kind of poor nerds.

583
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:37,800
Rym: This is our show.

584
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,744
Rym: This is what we've got.

585
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,693
Rym: and also look at Family Guy.

586
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:44,715
Rym: Family Guy was super popular Died and the nerds got what they wanted.

587
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:45,239
Rym: it came back.

588
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:52,973
Rym: Remember that first episode when it came back when they brought back Ollie Williams with the Blackie weather forecast And we knew that they knew what made the show funny.

589
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,280
Rym: and then they never did that again.

590
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:57,288
Rym: And the show is just self-referential crap and pop culture.

591
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:57,870
Rym: Hmm.

592
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:01,260
Rym: It's very rare that a show comes back and maintains goodness.

593
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:02,789
Scott: Yeah, it is very rare.

594
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,700
Scott: I mean the thing is I will not lie.

595
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:13,414
Scott: Personally think that the Futurama comeback was a you know It was a decline in quality But it was not so much of a decline as to no longer be good.

596
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:16,579
Scott: it like went from like 10 To like eight and a half, you know.

597
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:21,980
Rym: I would argue that most of the decline was in the interim movies because they were good but because they were long.

598
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,649
Rym: That was yeah, that was so tried to plot way too much.

599
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,174
Rym: and Futurama is not about plot.

600
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,020
Rym: It is about Azusa.

601
00:33:28,502 --> 00:33:30,652
Scott: Yeah, that was sort of the slope downwards, right?

602
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:35,279
Scott: It's like the movies were all okay But like the Beast of the Billion Backs that was way too long.

603
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,162
Scott: I really like the the one with the the fantasy one the best although vendors game was okay But it had.

604
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:45,058
Rym: it had some really kind of crap moments near the end.

605
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:51,580
Rym: It was kind of dumb, but it did individual jokes in that one made me laugh so hard that I almost peed.

606
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,931
Scott: Yeah, that's why I like it the best cuz it's all about the actual jokes, you know I mean that was the episode.

607
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:57,900
Rym: that was the one we watched.

608
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:11,518
Rym: Maybe might have just been because it was late But it was the whole front row crew like laying all on top of each other's big pile on that old-ass TV late at night after like a burning wheel game And he made that Hobbit joke and we laughed for like 20 minutes and couldn't stop and I couldn't breathe.

609
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,167
Rym: Yep That was the same night.

610
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,234
Rym: We watched Hypno Toad.

611
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:17,649
Scott: Yep But yeah, it's like, you know the movies.

612
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,324
Scott: they were alright and some of them were better than others But it's sort of like now.

613
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:21,985
Scott: they started this.

614
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:22,588
Scott: these.

615
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:29,989
Scott: I guess it's technically the 60s season because they're calling the movies the fifth season right and All the episodes in the current season.

616
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,175
Scott: I've watched most of them.

617
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:37,719
Scott: there might be one or two new ones I haven't watched but I've watched all the ones up, you know quite a few and the quality is pretty steady.

618
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,946
Scott: All the episodes are equal.

619
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,900
Scott: They're all funny, but none of them are oh my god funny.

620
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:44,560
Scott: They're not like memorable for all time funny.

621
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,313
Scott: They're just really good and worth watching.

622
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,699
Scott: kind of funny, you know.

623
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:55,899
Scott: Whereas I feel that the episodes from before right some of the older ones are all time funny, you know.

624
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:57,752
Scott: But that's how it goes.

625
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,257
Scott: it's better to have you know Some good stuff than to have no stuff.

626
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:05,376
Scott: Of course and especially in the absence of South Park where it also kind of treads this line between.

627
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:10,561
Rym: it is mostly comedy But there is kind of a plot and you do care about the characters like.

628
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:18,577
Rym: there is good writing a good story and you really like you are sympathetic and this is a show that makes a lot of people cry and it's very emotional sometimes.

629
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,924
Rym: the Dog episode.

630
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:21,467
Rym: Yeah.

631
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:32,960
Scott: I mean that is one thing that Futurama has family Right that South Park Simpsons Family Guy none of the other shows have and I think this is why nerds dig a little bit more.

632
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,872
Scott: Is that it actually has this mild continuity?

633
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:40,648
Scott: It's like any episode is episodic You can just watch it but sort of like cowboy bebop, right?

634
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:51,220
Scott: Some episodes are continuity episodes, you know and They they go with each other and the characters actually sort of kind of change a little bit over time.

635
00:35:51,401 --> 00:36:01,355
Scott: Personalities don't change their sticks don't change, you know bender still steals and is a jerk and you know You know, I noticed a claptrap in Borderlands is bender who's not a jerk.

636
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,888
Rym: I've decided that's right Cuz that's all he is he's bender.

637
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:05,660
Rym: bender was just not a complete asshole.

638
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:09,215
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, I gotta finish that game But the yeah.

639
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:25,006
Scott: but you have these characters that continue over time with a mild continuity to it and there's actually some development and Because of that they can actually Make a thing where you care about the characters based on their history Whereas like the Simpsons can't really do that.

640
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:35,140
Scott: They might be able to make an episode where the story of that single episode is Sad or you know has some sort of you know emotional message as opposed to just pure comedy.

641
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,280
Scott: But the characters can't change but they can't do it based on the main characters or anything like that.

642
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Scott: It has to be like oh my god You know Lisa Simpson met a really sad person and we learn about the sad person I get this in a recent episode.

643
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,788
Rym: They gave Bart a girlfriend.

644
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,477
Rym: Oh, man, and that didn't continue.

645
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,786
Rym: in the next episode The character just gone as far as I can tell.

646
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:57,214
Rym: Yeah, right, but it ended with like they're totally dating.

647
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:58,037
Rym: Mm-hmm.

648
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:01,489
Scott: Yeah And how'd you know that?

649
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,085
Rym: cuz I watched it whoa And I was reminded of her.

650
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:08,759
Rym: remember we had the private West Coast front row crew after party at PAX.

651
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:12,380
Rym: Yep, that episode was on the screen in the background where we were hanging out.

652
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:14,167
Scott: No, I barely looked at it.

653
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:17,700
Scott: I just I just sort of glanced and I was like, oh Simpsons and I didn't really watch the episode.

654
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,820
Scott: I didn't watch it either Subtitle so it wouldn't have mattered.

655
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,126
Rym: Anyway, it's that episode plus.

656
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,151
Rym: we were too busy hanging out with.

657
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:25,923
Rym: uh, Aaron Clark packs, Aaron Clark Not Otakon.

658
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:29,760
Scott: Aaron Clark good Aaron Clark not as evil twin from the east.

659
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,399
Scott: You got to make that clear, but I don't know if he's a twin not even close.

660
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:42,380
Scott: The Divergence of the level of awesomeness is so great It's like hard to imagine that both the people have the same name.

661
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,709
Rym: Wow, that was the side.

662
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:45,260
Scott: They have nothing else in common.

663
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,297
Rym: You realize that was simultaneously a shout-out and what I can only call a reverse shout-out.

664
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:54,378
Rym: Oh shit Luckily, I don't think the bad Aaron Clark actually listens to our show.

665
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,748
Scott: If he did it would make him less crappy.

666
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,298
Rym: there everyone whose name is Aaron Clark email us.

667
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:02,020
Rym: Let us know you listen.

668
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,947
Scott: Let's get the phone book.

669
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,480
Scott: There's plenty of Aaron Clark's in the phone.

670
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:06,869
Scott: There's no shortage.

671
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:12,268
Scott: I At least ten in any phone book Any US phone book.

672
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,648
Rym: I just can't help but think back to.

673
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:26,320
Rym: we were having some argument at the shore about like information being free and your argument was basically the phone book never killed anyone and I think my Rebuttal and proof that you were wrong was Sarah Connor.

674
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,472
Rym: Anyway Sarah Connor lived the other like seven.

675
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,455
Rym: Sarah Connors didn't.

676
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:34,800
Scott: that's their problem.

677
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,020
Rym: so Futurama It's awesome.

678
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,990
Rym: Yeah It's hard to review things that we like.

679
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,380
Scott: What's what's some of your favorite?

680
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,494
Rym: Episode that's such a crap.

681
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,179
Rym: cop-out.

682
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,640
Scott: What about that makes them your favorite episodes again?

683
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,860
Rym: So my favorite episode straight up is the gargoyle one because it has the old jokes.

684
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,440
Rym: I'm stealing my favorite episode as the old jokes and the gargoyle and then just and now a little one is that is how pop?

685
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:04,323
Rym: Freedom.

686
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:05,767
Scott: that is how papa gets freedom.

687
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:09,639
Rym: now born we born we tell you are born to me.

688
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:11,146
Rym: That was hmm.

689
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,051
Rym: I don't know.

690
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:13,840
Rym: There's something about that episode.

691
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:22,954
Scott: Well, it's because it's like they all fall in like the time goop and they're like There are so many like concise quotable memes in it.

692
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,938
Scott: My what my Get a job got a job.

693
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,387
Scott: I forgot Was in the same episode.

694
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:29,970
Rym: I don't think so.

695
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,553
Scott: I don't know.

696
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:31,940
Scott: that was also an excellent episode.

697
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,799
Scott: Time traveling boxes and they get a job.

698
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:36,985
Scott: That's a good one.

699
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:38,533
Rym: That wasn't time traveling boxes.

700
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:39,700
Rym: That was universes in boxes.

701
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,291
Scott: All right universe is in the boxes.

702
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,360
Rym: kind of inception.

703
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:42,881
Scott: They're all.

704
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,005
Scott: they all feel the same way.

705
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:48,620
Scott: like a time travel episode a universe switching episode a space travel planet switching episode.

706
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,807
Scott: They don't feel they don't feel like the same thing.

707
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,472
Rym: They didn't actually travel through time.

708
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,037
Rym: They just started going.

709
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,820
Rym: they started merlin.

710
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:58,685
Scott: yeah, the time travel episode was the Fry.

711
00:39:58,725 --> 00:39:59,228
Scott: does the grant?

712
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:00,535
Scott: does the grandma episode?

713
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:00,977
Rym: Yes.

714
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:15,918
Scott: Yeah But that would the time travel time shifting of bodies and world boxes for three different episodes you realize yeah It's also I think that sometimes there are self-referential jokes in Futurama Like though like they'll insult fry for getting with his grandma or something like that.

715
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,779
Scott: But all right, so I remember they trying to them doing that.

716
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:19,542
Scott: But it's not.

717
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:20,023
Scott: it's not like.

718
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:31,640
Scott: it's different to reference your own continuity to make a joke that it is to Sort of just retell the same joke over and over again like just Ali Williams is there.

719
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:35,351
Rym: I think it's only a matter of artistry because you can do both.

720
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:39,094
Rym: venture brothers and Archer did the self-referential thing I think the right way.

721
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,208
Rym: Futurama does it in like a plotty way.

722
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:42,950
Rym: That's also good.

723
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:46,989
Rym: and say family guy at first They made the self-referential.

724
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,318
Rym: that was kind of the meta like.

725
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,519
Rym: haha We know that you like to this character and his one joke.

726
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,714
Rym: But then they just kind of keep using like these meta jokes like that chick.

727
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,540
Rym: it was fucking come out of nowhere and attack Peters.

728
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,244
Rym: Like all right.

729
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,696
Scott: Yeah, it's like think about this Ollie Williams from Family Guy, right?

730
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:01,440
Scott: Why is he funny?

731
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,166
Scott: He's funny because it came out of no, it's funny because it came out of nowhere and because he says it in a funny way It's gonna rain.

732
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,014
Scott: It's gonna rain, right?

733
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:10,024
Scott: It's a Physicality of it.

734
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,474
Scott: the sound of it is funny.

735
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:13,022
Scott: It's just a funny sound It's no.

736
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:17,560
Scott: it's funny for the same reason that getting hit with a pie in the face is funny because it looks funny, right?

737
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:17,761
Scott: It's.

738
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,620
Scott: it's just hilarious to look at and out of the ordinary.

739
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,352
Rym: So if you're just gonna reference it straight you do it again.

740
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,891
Scott: It's not it's only funny It's not actually funny to just for him.

741
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,260
Scott: Just just keep saying it's gonna rain.

742
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:41,233
Rym: Look doing the same the exact same joke or the same style of joke one more time Later is also funny cuz that you know, a lot of comedians do that, but it's funny because hey Hey, I'm reminded of the funny joke from a second ago.

743
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:42,279
Scott: That's not an old joke.

744
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,292
Rym: yet You can't do it the third time unless you do the comedian thing.

745
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:51,540
Rym: where you do it once do it twice Don't do it for a long time and then bring it all back to that at the end.

746
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:56,330
Scott: But you can't do that across multiple episodes Oh and again within a single episode.

747
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,525
Scott: right if you do it across multiple episodes That doesn't work.

748
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,680
Rym: but like look at Archer and Venture Brothers.

749
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:07,975
Rym: This is where you can do the sort of self-referential Comedy in the right way because then it's more of a character development thing.

750
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,683
Rym: Like you're getting to know the character That's what future.

751
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:10,186
Scott: I'm ahead.

752
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,380
Rym: Yeah, but the other ones like an archer they have this thing.

753
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:19,690
Rym: We're like in one of the early episodes like someone's like that's how you get ants and the other characters like hey yep, and they said like a yep kind of a like front row crew.

754
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,513
Rym: we have stuff like that.

755
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:24,346
Rym: we say things in certain ways and That yep.

756
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:32,860
Rym: Nope kind of Characters do that to each other the way friends do throughout the entire show and then it becomes kind of this meta joke later.

757
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:34,828
Rym: Mmm, that's the right way to do it.

758
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,898
Rym: Not just having the chicken suit come out.

759
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,319
Rym: Yell It's going to rain while a deaf guy runs by all greased up.

760
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,706
Rym: Yeah, family guy's not funny anymore.

761
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:44,211
Scott: Here's it is another example, right?

762
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,920
Scott: So Bender has his bite my shiny metal ass, right?

763
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,548
Rym: Remember when he didn't have his shiny metal ass?

764
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,192
Scott: that is that is very similar.

765
00:42:51,313 --> 00:42:53,760
Rym: bite my majestic golden ass to benders.

766
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:54,789
Scott: To Bart's.

767
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,859
Scott: eat my shorts, right?

768
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,705
Scott: But bender I mean Bart.

769
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:01,920
Scott: he stopped at the heat my shorts and the I Caramba and such and don't have a cow man.

770
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,362
Scott: Why?

771
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:08,679
Scott: he only really said those things once and they were only Memorable slogans because people put them on t-shirts and shit, right?

772
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,883
Rym: Think of this back then.

773
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,433
Rym: this is just kind of unrelated food for thought.

774
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,280
Rym: back then in the eat my shorts.

775
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:15,792
Rym: I Caramba era of the Simpsons.

776
00:43:15,812 --> 00:43:19,460
Rym: I Cedar Point had to turn my I Caramba shirt inside out.

777
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:22,711
Rym: They wouldn't let me into the park because it was bad.

778
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:24,918
Scott: and what's bad about I Caramba?

779
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:28,471
Rym: back then Parents would not let kids watch the fucking Simpsons.

780
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,060
Rym: the Simpsons was the controversial show.

781
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,235
Scott: But by my shining metal ass is better than I could look how far societies come.

782
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,720
Scott: we've come a long way.

783
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:44,573
Scott: Yeah, we have but anyway the yeah, so That those jokes, you know, they really only told them once in the Simpsons.

784
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:45,717
Scott: They couldn't really do.

785
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,027
Scott: use them again You know to great effect.

786
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:48,952
Scott: They were basically just.

787
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:50,219
Scott: they just fell flat recently.

788
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,420
Rym: They did a few eat my shorts jokes, but the thing is a bender.

789
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,894
Rym: They were a hundred percent meta, but you can do bite my shine in my last.

790
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,560
Scott: but he doesn't just say it, right?

791
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,611
Scott: They remix it each time they have learned from the internet.

792
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,037
Scott: So instead of it.

793
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:10,540
Scott: He will buy my Golden, and he only said like bite my shiny metal ass like a few times, you know.

794
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:16,840
Scott: And every other time he said it It was always a remix like he was wooden once and he would be like bite my splinter.

795
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,783
Scott: He wouldn't ass.

796
00:44:17,944 --> 00:44:24,386
Scott: or one time like his ass fell off or something and he was like, oh no bite No, he sold it to the devil.

797
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:25,350
Rym: No, right.

798
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,158
Scott: He sold sold his ass to the devil.

799
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:32,479
Scott: Yeah You know, so they mix it up if they want to reuse it, you know.

800
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:42,763
Scott: I mean if Bart actually did stuff with his shorts, you know or found interest they could have kept that going But they were not as clever and because they didn't have the continuity Right.

801
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:49,315
Scott: Hey, that was really a flop if they would have tried to do that at all And there was no way they could have kept it going for that many years.

802
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:53,704
Scott: cuz you know Simpsons did it Except Simpsons did.

803
00:44:53,744 --> 00:44:55,430
Rym: it is almost a South Park at this point.

804
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,634
Scott: It is indeed a South Park.

805
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,545
Scott: It is indeed All right, is there anything else to say here?

806
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:08,723
Rym: Uh, the only thing I really want to say is that Futurama started in In 1999.

807
00:45:08,723 --> 00:45:10,148
Scott: I know how fucked up is that right?

808
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,296
Rym: She's like 12 years ago.

809
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:13,500
Scott: It went for four years.

810
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:24,024
Scott: so in oh three it ended years ago ended in oh three and the movies came out when uh, 2003?

811
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,553
Scott: well, no, that's when the TV show ended.

812
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:26,820
Scott: So when did the first movie come out?

813
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,913
Scott: 2008. so there are five years of no Futurama.

814
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,380
Scott: That's a fucking long time.

815
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:37,538
Rym: So, uh, Team Fortress 2 was what like nine years ten years in the making.

816
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:38,702
Rym: and then holy shit It came out.

817
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,210
Rym: Duke Nukem forever even fucking came out.

818
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:41,792
Scott: It did it.

819
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:44,140
Scott: Yeah, it's not in the stores yet.

820
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:45,284
Rym: I played it.

821
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:45,846
Rym: you played it.

822
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:46,789
Scott: you played a demo.

823
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,733
Scott: there were demos before.

824
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:50,645
Rym: I fucking played Duke Nukem forever John St.

825
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:50,907
Rym: John.

826
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,180
Rym: the voice of Duke Nukem took me into the back room.

827
00:45:53,481 --> 00:46:02,220
Scott: I fucking played a fuck you with his balls of steel and then a booth babe gave me a tank top Tank top to cover up after.

828
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:09,394
Scott: The thing is that just because you could have played it just a demo there was.

829
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,720
Scott: that was not the full game.

830
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,603
Scott: It is not in the store.

831
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:12,205
Scott: We do not know.

832
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:30,220
Rym: So I think the real notable thing about Futurama is that Nerds always demand shit and sometimes like in the situation of tribes - you've got to ignore those nerds and not fuck up your game Mmm, and sometimes the situation of Family Guy, you've got to understand what made your show great in the first place.

833
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:41,120
Rym: I mean, you know We did a whole panel of packs where we talked about like Actraiser this video game and it had the overworld map thing That was cool and had this shitty side-scroller kind of tacked on and the game was super popular.

834
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:43,092
Rym: So the people who made it were like, you know what?

835
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:44,360
Rym: Let's make a sequel.

836
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:46,557
Rym: Nobody cared about that cool overworld part.

837
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,288
Rym: clearly What made this game awesome was that shitty side-scroller.

838
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,580
Rym: make a sequel just shitty side-scroller.

839
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:57,754
Rym: Yeah, I feel like Family Guy when it came back did that they they're like what made the show popular.

840
00:46:58,296 --> 00:46:59,780
Rym: stupid self-referential humor.

841
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:00,878
Rym: Let's just go with that.

842
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:05,036
Scott: They were lazy and it worked, you know, I mean, that's the one thing.

843
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,160
Scott: look at South Park, right?

844
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,760
Scott: They started off with poop jokes.

845
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,267
Scott: It seems like all the shows start with food.

846
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:11,679
Rym: scarily enough watching some South Park again.

847
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:16,340
Rym: The poop joke era lasted like a few episodes in the first season.

848
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,318
Rym: They got into social commentary like actual social commentary and jokes that weren't just.

849
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,829
Rym: oh my god Those kids are swearing pretty fucking quick.

850
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:33,750
Scott: Yeah, it's it's like a difficulty curve in a video game You start with low difficulty you get with the low brow and then you raise the brow with a nice difficult You know challenge curve, you know, you got.

851
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:35,640
Scott: the show gets progressively more difficult.

852
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,716
Rym: I mean South Park today is I think some of the better popular social commentary television out there.

853
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:41,839
Scott: Maybe the best.

854
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,030
Scott: But you know the some of these other shows like Family Guy.

855
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,615
Scott: they lowered the brow.

856
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:48,940
Scott: They didn't raise the brow.

857
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,884
Rym: Family Guy is not saying anything about society.

858
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:52,706
Scott: Not really.

859
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:57,966
Scott: No, you know, the Simpsons does sometimes and Futurama does every.

860
00:47:58,026 --> 00:48:00,074
Rym: it says such a milquetoast things nowadays.

861
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:04,332
Scott: Futurama does sometimes Kinda, but that's about it.

862
00:48:04,775 --> 00:48:06,904
Scott: It's all good All right.

863
00:48:07,306 --> 00:48:19,819
Rym: I think Futurama social commentary is more taking Everything that it like every trend in our current world and just driving them out to the extreme Exaggeration of what if this course continues that long?

864
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,520
Rym: Mmm, and in that way, it's weird I'll.

865
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:32,940
Rym: Futurama is incredibly like over-the-top and inaccurate and yet in many ways very like Spiritually accurate to what our society is like if you take it to the extreme in every direction at once.

866
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,779
Scott: I guess that really applies to its theme of future Futurama, right?

867
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:48,763
Scott: You know you take something that we have currently and you extract it through the future And you you know, I mean you look at have all like the famous people of current time with their heads are in a jar And stuff like that.

868
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:55,120
Rym: Yeah, we'll look at like the like the popular style architecture or they'll be like, it'll be like no robo sex.

869
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,120
Scott: You know, there's a social commentary in a Futurama.

870
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,826
Rym: Yeah, but it's so.

871
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:00,569
Scott: it takes like.

872
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,620
Scott: it takes a current social issue and extracts it out to the future robo.

873
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:06,368
Rym: Yep, but they rarely make focus of the episode.

874
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:09,418
Rym: The real focus of the episode is the character driven joke humor.

875
00:49:09,438 --> 00:49:12,420
Rym: joke If I got a word is joke humor.

876
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,240
Scott: That's what South Park, right?

877
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:21,700
Scott: Will make the focus of the episode that social commentary and have the sort of plot on the side Whereas Futurama is the same thing only flips slightly.

878
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,820
Rym: So right part of my feeling about South Park is colored by the fact that I've watched so many of those one episode commentaries.

879
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,460
Scott: We watch the Futurama Extras and things but the commentaries weren't as good.

880
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,860
Rym: They didn't talk as much about like the jokes and they were long and I want to watch them all the way through.

881
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:47,352
Rym: It wasn't like South Park where they'll tell you the secret that yeah this whole episode I really really wanted to see Cartman in his little boat t-shirt.

882
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,359
Rym: I feel like that really like that's funny to me.

883
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,592
Rym: He's really funny or we didn't know what the fuck we were doing.

884
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:53,336
Rym: So crab people.

885
00:49:53,356 --> 00:50:01,790
Rym: Yeah This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
