1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,309
Rym: It's Monday, November 17th, 2014.

2
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,240
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,226
Rym: What fucking phone to buy in 2014?

4
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,229
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,260
Rym: So my computer at work is actually, like, the hard drive is dying.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,345
Scott: So just buy a hard drive.

7
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:33,180
Rym: Yeah, but you know what, my computer is shitty, so instead- Why do you have a shitty computer?

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,760
Rym: Because it was the one that when I first got there, they were like, "Well, we need a computer,".

9
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:44,000
Rym: so I just walked down to the store next door and just bought one on the company card and just- You didn't go to New Egg and buy a computer?

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,020
Rym: Because I needed it, like, right then, and I didn't need anything particularly good.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,520
Rym: I mean, for the first chunk of my job, most of my job is writing emails or, like, drawing things.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,700
Scott: Why don't you just get, like, a MacBook?

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,020
Rym: Yeah, you know what, most of that stuff I do on my own laptop, because I- so, anyway.

14
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:09,680
Rym: The problem with buying a computer from anyone who sells computers as opposed to parts of computers- Is that they're full of shit?

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,960
Rym: It's not just that they're full of shit.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,280
Scott: In terms of installed software?

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,083
Rym: Oh, no, fuck that.

18
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,456
Rym: I still installed, like, clean windows on it.

19
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,300
Rym: That wasn't a problem.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,100
Scott: So I realized this because a lot- Did you get ripped off money-wise?

21
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:21,066
Rym: Who cares?

22
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,014
Rym: It was a company card.

23
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:22,680
Rym: We're in a hurry.

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,479
Scott: Someone else's money.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,081
Rym: Plus, that computer was, like, $400.

26
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,131
Scott: Okay, sure.

27
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:27,980
Scott: No wonder it broke.

28
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:34,739
Rym: A lot of people we know, like, even smart people we know, like, people on Twitter, some of you are listening to this.

29
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,540
Rym: They buy computers from, like, Dell.

30
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:47,855
Rym: And they try to tell me, or they try to tell themselves, that, "Sure, you could make a computer a little bit cheaper if you made it yourself, but it's not worth the

31
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:48,200
Rym: hassle.".

32
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:48,637
Rym: You know what?

33
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:54,339
Rym: The reason you guys are wrong is actually something very specific, and that reason is hard drives.

34
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,879
Rym: I needed a new computer for work.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,133
Rym: The CTO was like, "Well, just buy a fucking computer.

36
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:00,354
Rym: Go.

37
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:00,535
Rym: Buy

38
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:00,857
Rym: whatever.".

39
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,719
Rym: So I go online, I look around, like, Dell and HP.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
Rym: Does anyone who'll just sell me a computer?

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,180
Rym: Pretty much no one sells computers that have, like, more than one hard drive or even an SSD.

42
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,300
Scott: In terms of, like, desktop ones?

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:16,507
Rym: Yeah.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,920
Scott: Yeah, no, you'd have to go to, like, the workstation categories.

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,216
Rym: Even then, usually they offer- The options are, like, one terabyte shit disk, two terabyte shit disk, really tiny SSD.

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,380
Scott: Oh, Rym, you're buying a computer for work with a company card, right?

47
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:33,680
Scott: You don't care about money.

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,340
Scott: Why don't you get the Mac Pro trash can?

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,634
Scott: You're only writing emails.

50
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:39,080
Scott: It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:41,559
Scott: What do you care?

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,920
Scott: It's someone else's money.

53
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:47,520
Scott: And then- Or why don't you get the Retina iMac with the ridiculous screen?

54
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,399
Scott: It's like you're writing emails.

55
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,700
Scott: It doesn't need to play games.

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,320
Scott: It just needs to have the most amazing screen it ever created.

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,679
Rym: Yeah, the thing is- 5K screen.

58
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:57,279
Scott: What I got instead- Imagine reading emails on that shit.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,020
Scott: What I got instead was what a company actually does now- If I didn't have to do any gaming or any programming, I would use a Mac.

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,480
Scott: That is the only two reasons I don't have any Macs.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,380
Rym: So, Scott, actually, we're pretty smart now.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,300
Rym: Like, I wasn't paying attention.

63
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,760
Rym: Like, when they hire new people, they basically buy them, like, a stock Asus thing from Newegg, and they're actually, like, super cheap.

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,660
Rym: And for most people, like, they're great, and they cost, like, nothing.

65
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:20,192
Scott: But they don't have a 5K screen.

66
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,356
Rym: No, no, they don't.

67
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:26,673
Scott: I'm holding out for, eventually, I'll just buy- What is there to hold out for besides a 5K monitor?

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,879
Rym: Yeah, so right now, you know what I got to hold out for?

69
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:32,820
Rym: I can't get that monitor unless it's attached to a Mac.

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,678
Scott: What's wrong with that?

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Rym: Macs can't really run the Java stuff that I actually do at work sometimes.

72
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:41,600
Scott: Oh, well, that's the reason I don't have one at work either, programming.

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,575
Scott: Yeah, but- You could use the-.

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:04:01,460
Rym: So then I realized, talking to, you know, all those people who stupidly buy, like, HPs and Dells or Alienwares or whatever, and I realized that 99% of the reason their computers are slow is that almost all of them have one spinning disk as their hard drive.

75
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:15,919
Rym: So, yeah, guys, I looked around to try to figure out, like, is it possible to build a computer that has, like, an SSD for your games and shit, and an SSD for the OS, and then, like, one spinning disk just for, like, your Blu-ray-

76
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,539
Scott: More than one hard drive requires knowing how file systems work.

77
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,099
Scott: 99% of users, it'll actually be a problem for them.

78
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,800
Scott: Yeah, so, uh- It'll also make the computer bigger and worse.

79
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,678
Scott: You just can't.

80
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,118
Scott: Physically.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,558
Rym: People don't sell those.

82
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,760
Scott: No, you gotta buy a motherboard with a ton of SATA cables and build one.

83
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,140
Rym: Don't even need a ton, you basically just need, at most, three.

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,919
Rym: So, anyway, I actually found one.

85
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:41,899
Scott: So, Newegg- Can't you get a Dell Optiplex and configure it?

86
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,894
Rym: They're configur- I tried that configurator.

87
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,680
Scott: Can't you get a Lenovo ThinkPad?

88
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,795
Scott: Because, usually, the laptop will have a SSD.

89
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,738
Rym: Yeah, but the laptops aren't-.

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
Rym: So, here's what I actually- Couldn't you get a Microsoft Surface Pro?

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Scott: That'll have an SSD in it.

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,140
Rym: Yeah, you know what I actually want to do with my computer?

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,780
Rym: The only reason I considered, like, getting one with multiple hard drives?

94
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:09,840
Rym: If I have an SSD, and a lot of RAM, and, like, an i7 or something, I can really easily run a whole bunch of VMs locally, just for my own bullshit.

95
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,419
Scott: You know you can do that on the Mac Pro.

96
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:12,639
Rym: Yeah, I could.

97
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:15,160
Scott: And if it's VMs, then you still have your programming problem.

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,939
Rym: So, Newegg actually has a configurator to build a gaming PC.

99
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:21,039
Scott: Oh, there you go.

100
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,520
Scott: Instead of just choosing the parts.

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,600
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:24,940
Rym: That's new.

103
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,719
Scott: If it's not new, I haven't seen it.

104
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,800
Rym: It's like the iBuyPower or whatever, and it's really simple.

105
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,320
Rym: They give you, like, here's eight case options, here's your RAM options, here's your whatever options, like, really straightforward.

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,699
Scott: And it's guaranteed to make a computer that works?

107
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,074
Rym: Yes.

108
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:40,500
Rym: And the options are, like, really straightforward and streamlined.

109
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:48,880
Scott: And they're not giving you choices, like, they're not hiding from you, like, there are other RAM sticks that are the same as these RAM sticks, but five bucks cheaper, but they're not in the configurator.

110
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,079
Rym: No, you know how they describe it?

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,680
Rym: It's like eight gigabytes of generic RAM included.

112
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Rym: Eight gigabytes of G.Skill whatever RAM, plus twenty dollars.

113
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,340
Scott: So under hard drives, So you're getting the cheapest possible RAM stick you could get.

114
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:17,029
Rym: But under hard drives, they had options ranging from one giant fucking two terabyte spinning disk, because whatever, and one of the options was one 256 gigabyte SSD and one two terabyte spinning disk.

115
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,280
Rym: Both generic.

116
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:29,338
Rym: So I look at the FAQ and they're like, yes, we install the OS on the SSD.

117
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:32,520
Rym: And then the other one is just mounted for your whatever.

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Scott: Oh, they install the OS for you?

119
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,760
Rym: They install everything.

120
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,479
Rym: Clean windows, though.

121
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,520
Scott: Is it really clean windows?

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,160
Rym: I'm going to find out if it's really clean windows.

123
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,140
Rym: It arrives, like, tomorrow.

124
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:41,079
Scott: Are they going to give you the disk?

125
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:45,440
Rym: But the best part was the thing was under a thousand dollars and it works.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,738
Rym: So I think we'll see.

127
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,380
Scott: Oh, there's nothing wrong with my computer.

128
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,860
Rym: But no, because you and me, I would not buy that motherboard.

129
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:54,899
Rym: Oh, OK.

130
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,680
Rym: But for work, that motherboards probably fine.

131
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,299
Scott: Yeah, that's that's good to know.

132
00:06:59,632 --> 00:06:59,716
Rym: Yeah.

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,080
Scott: It actually like how much do they charge you for the labor of putting it together?

134
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:09,920
Rym: I didn't say it was just like there was a base price and then it was plus X for any option above the default.

135
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:15,039
Scott: I guess we know what to suggest to people who need a computer, but don't want to do the physical building of one.

136
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:25,679
Rym: Basically, if you don't know about computers, all you have to do is go to that thing, pick your budget and pick options until you're at that budget and then just hit buy and it's guaranteed to work.

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,558
Scott: Way to go, new egg.

138
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,699
Rym: Yeah, like a new egg.

139
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,559
Scott: Become a public company.

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,139
Rym: I paid the five extra dollars to get them because the default case.

141
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:34,799
Rym: Is ugly as fuck.

142
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,559
Scott: Who cares?

143
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:39,720
Rym: It looks like no, it's like one of those like bright glass led.

144
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:41,780
Scott: Oh, that's the default one.

145
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,116
Scott: Yeah.

146
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:45,820
Rym: And then the next one up for five bucks is like a little more tasteful.

147
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:49,119
Rym: So I paid five bucks to be a little more tasteful.

148
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,999
Scott: I'm sure you could open it and taking LEDs out.

149
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:51,720
Rym: Probably.

150
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,338
Rym: Maybe it's well, maybe it's called cathode tubes.

151
00:07:55,641 --> 00:08:02,019
Rym: So, yeah, but I'm still amazed that people buy computers like that.

152
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:03,679
Rym: I don't know if they know, but they don't.

153
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:04,239
Scott: Not too many.

154
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,679
Scott: The market's gone down to the shitter.

155
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:06,799
Rym: I know, I know.

156
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,220
Scott: People just use their phone.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,474
Rym: Yeah, they use their phablet.

158
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:19,480
Scott: Or their phablet or their tablet, or maybe they have a Mac or maybe they have a Surface Pro 2, pretty much nothing else sells.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Rym: Increasingly, people who don't make things with computers.

160
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
Rym: I've seen people, like they literally don't own computers anymore.

161
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,080
Scott: You don't play PC games and you don't use computers to create things like using Adobe products or programming.

162
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:35,259
Scott: You don't really need a desktop computer as much.

163
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,839
Scott: Anyway, speaking of, so here's the technology news for New York, where we live.

164
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,199
Scott: There are a lot of gentrification monoliths going up around.

165
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,760
Rym: Yeah, those things.

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:09:01,900
Scott: There's one particular kind that's going up called Link NYC, which is going to be a weird kind of thing that lets you make phone calls or call 911 or 311 or it also has advertisements on the side.

167
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,160
Rym: So imagine a sponsored, modern version of the old telegraph.

168
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,199
Rym: pull this thing to get the firemen to come.

169
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,390
Scott: Yeah, sort of.

170
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:15,079
Scott: But all of these things are going to have in them free Wi-Fi, free public Wi-Fi.

171
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,415
Scott: I think it's going to be ad-supported Wi-Fi, like that's.

172
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:24,158
Scott: what's going to pay for it, is the subway Boingo Wi-Fi where when you connect, it makes you watch an ad and then you get your Wi-Fi.

173
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,220
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

174
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,980
Scott: Yeah, but it's supposedly, here's the interesting technology bit.

175
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:34,179
Scott: Even if you don't live in New York and you don't care, this isn't even going to happen for like a long time anyway, like late next year, probably.

176
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:40,340
Scott: It's they're saying that they're going to provide Wi-Fi, quote, up to gigabit speed.

177
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:47,960
Scott: So first of all, even if there's like a gigabit fiber cable going to this thing and has gigabit Internet.

178
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,180
Scott: What Wi-Fi is gigabit speed?

179
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:59,579
Scott: Even if it's AC Wi-Fi, the best Wi-Fi consumer you can get right now and you have a brand new iPhone six, whatever that can do AC.

180
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,199
Scott: That ain't going to be anywhere close to gigabit.

181
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,180
Rym: Is it possible that maybe they just mean each pylon has a total bandwidth of a gigabyte?

182
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,748
Scott: I mean, it's not.

183
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:21,279
Scott: each person download at most a gigabyte before they're like, whoa, dog, the company only notes that gigabit Wi-Fi is more than 100 times faster than the average public Wi-Fi and more than 20 times faster than the average home Internet service in NYC.

184
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Scott: Downloading a two hour HD movie can take as little as 30 seconds.

185
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,443
Scott: So they're actively promoting the fact that you can download an HD movie in 30 seconds, by using this.

186
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,175
Scott: But you fucking can't, even if you're using 802.11 AC Wi-Fi.

187
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:39,580
Rym: So I'll admit I'm not up on recent changes to Wi-Fi.

188
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:40,994
Scott: Basically, there was 802.11 G.

189
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:42,104
Rym: I know.

190
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:43,819
Scott: there was an and then there was AC.

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Scott: Yeah, you don't have to know is that AC is the newest and the fastest.

192
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,479
Rym: When I was the last time I looked into Wi-Fi was that RIT when I had access to like.

193
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,920
Rym: we had some like and stuff like early and like we could play with and we learned how the signaling worked.

194
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,379
Rym: And I learned a lot about how A, B and G signal and that was it.

195
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,728
Rym: Basically, I don't know.

196
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:03,759
Rym: I don't even know about AC.

197
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,278
Scott: All you have to know is AC is the best.

198
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,314
Rym: How fast is it?

199
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,077
Scott: Faster, faster than N.

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,299
Rym: Do you know anything about it?

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,640
Scott: I know it's the best and the best and that only like the newest Apple devices and some other shit has it and it's not something you can just do.

202
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,870
Rym: 802.11 AC.

203
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:17,799
Rym: Let's look this up right now.

204
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,091
Rym: Yeah, up to a gigabit.

205
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:19,840
Rym: So it's totally.

206
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,559
Scott: Is that true?

207
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:20,891
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:21,369
Scott: Oh.

209
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,740
Rym: Multi-station WLAN support of at least one gigabit per second.

210
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,980
Rym: Single link throughput of 500 megabit per second.

211
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:31,339
Rym: Oh, oh, it does the.

212
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,979
Rym: So this supports doing the multi-station stuff, kind of like what HDSPA+ does.

213
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:40,034
Rym: So your phone has 4G.

214
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,419
Rym: My old Nexus 4 does not.

215
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,520
Scott: My phone is LTE, which is not real.

216
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,197
Scott: I mean, well, it's effectively.

217
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:52,918
Rym: So my Nexus 4 does do HDSPA and HDSPA+.

218
00:11:53,883 --> 00:12:09,220
Rym: HDSPA allows a certain amount of download bandwidth and HDSPA+ basically, if you're in range of multiple cell towers, it can connect to multiple of them and max each of those channels out if there's not enough congestion to block you so you can get more bandwidth.

219
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,640
Rym: I've only ever seen that work in Australia, actually.

220
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
Rym: It never works in the US.

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,879
Scott: 4G for me did not work in Australia, but I will get the different carrier next time.

222
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:23,320
Rym: So I basically, it looks like 802.11ac does something very similar.

223
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,379
Rym: I will learn about this and talk about it in a future episode of GeekNights because I've been way behind on this stuff.

224
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Scott: All right.

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,600
Scott: Yeah.

226
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,238
Scott: Should I buy it?

227
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,219
Scott: I mean, I think my iPhone 6 can do it.

228
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,780
Scott: So will it be worth it for me to buy an AC router?

229
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,578
Scott: You know, we should definitely have one at work, though.

230
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,151
Rym: Yeah.

231
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,180
Scott: Anyway.

232
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,498
Rym: Oh, okay.

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,860
Rym: There's a lot of, whoa, okay.

234
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:46,000
Rym: There's interesting stuff on this Wikipedia page.

235
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:49,700
Rym: I got to see how much of this is available versus potential.

236
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,153
Rym: So yeah.

237
00:12:51,800 --> 00:13:00,399
Rym: In other news, you know how we always talk about more, like we've done panels in the past where if you made a sim that was- A sim card?

238
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,140
Rym: No, like a sim person, like in the Sims game.

239
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:03,799
Scott: Oh, okay.

240
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,580
Rym: If you made a sim ant that fully emulated the behavior of a real ant, is it wrong to torture that ant in the game?

241
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,378
Rym: You know, that kind of thing.

242
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:21,860
Rym: Uh, there's an article here and it's not quite there yet, but this is close enough to where the discussion has to start happening for real.

243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,316
Rym: Basically, there's a worm, C. elegans, and C. elegans only has 302 neurons.

244
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,036
Rym: So someone made a project called open worm to fully emulate the behavior of those 302 neurons.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,940
Scott: I mean, is it perfect down to the quark or whatever the fuck micro particle?

246
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:44,220
Rym: No, so in the sense of, there's a lot more details here- It's not a simulation of the entire universe.

247
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,378
Rym: No, it's a simulation of the behavior of these neurons, meaning the ordering sequences- I mean, how accurate is it?

248
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:57,219
Scott: Did they get a worm, directly clone its neuron state, and put it next to the table next to the simulation, and they were doing the exact same thing?

249
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,700
Scott: Well, basically, so what they did- How do they simulate the exact stimuli of the environment?

250
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,860
Rym: Because the worm has very little sensory input.

251
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:06,439
Rym: Okay.

252
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:08,740
Rym: Basically, the worm's not super complex.

253
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,400
Rym: 302 neurons that don't appear to have dendritic interactions that matter.

254
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:30,360
Rym: One way to map a neural structure would be that you can look at three neurons connected to a fourth neuron, two of them fire, and the third one doesn't, but the two is above the threshold, so then the next neuron in the chain fires.

255
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:31,179
Rym: That kind of thing.

256
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:32,799
Rym: That's what they're doing here.

257
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:40,560
Rym: There's another kind of interaction where the individual dendrites themselves might have further biologic, essentially.

258
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,820
Scott: Biologic?

259
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:43,340
Rym: Well, just like logic.

260
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:45,471
Scott: You said biologic, I'm like,

261
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:45,673
Scott: "What?".

262
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,760
Rym: No, I just swallowed and then said logic.

263
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:51,557
Scott: Because you said biologic, I'm like, "Is he trying to say

264
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:52,000
Scott: biologic?"?

265
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,160
Rym: No, I'm fighting off the end of that plague that I had from Australia.

266
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,037
Rym: The worm plague?

267
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:16,219
Rym: So basically, what they did is they took that code then that emulates this worm pretty well, and they made a robot that had the same number of basic inputs and outputs, and they put the software on the robot, and then they presented the robot with stimuli, and they presented worms with the same kind of stimuli, and they would react in the same way.

268
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,017
Scott: All right.

269
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:30,000
Rym: And this is like baby's first step into... We have to start having that ethical conversation that up until this point, everyone rational says, "But that's theoretical.

270
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,219
Rym: Why should we talk about that?

271
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,155
Rym: That's stupid and will never

272
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:32,399
Rym: happen.".

273
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,479
Rym: We're getting close to that.

274
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,280
Rym: So this article is fascinating to read about, on one hand, how close we are to having... Is it wrong to torture this robot?

275
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,240
Rym: And on the other hand, 302 neurons is still pretty fucking hard to emulate.

276
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,860
Scott: Well, if you're having trouble answering these questions for yourself, make it more difficult by watching Alien and then Aliens.

277
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:58,880
Rym: I can watch those movies again.

278
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,400
Rym: It's been a while.

279
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,860
Scott: I watch those movies every day if I want.

280
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,179
Rym: We should talk about those on gig nights.

281
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:03,689
Scott: Yeah.

282
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,000
Rym: So one other news real quick.

283
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,480
Rym: There's a bunch of articles just broke all at once in the last week, and they basically all said the same thing.

284
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,620
Rym: They were all like, "Is Google Glass dead?

285
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,098
Rym: Isn't everyone dropping Google

286
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:16,220
Rym: Glass?".

287
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,360
Scott: Anything that doesn't make a lot of marketing noise constantly must be dead.

288
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,860
Rym: So I read all those... Well, not all of them.

289
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,580
Rym: I read all the articles that run mainstream tech press.

290
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,380
Scott: I'm sure it started with one guy writing an article, and every other media outlet just copying.

291
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:37,680
Rym: Because way back, I never talked about this on gig nights, but back when I was working at the hospital and I got sick of it, for a while, I went to go take the LSAT.

292
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,614
Rym: So I was like, "Fuck it, I'll be a

293
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:38,920
Rym: lawyer.".

294
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,886
Rym: Then a bunch of listeners who were lawyers were like, "No, you will regret

295
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:41,987
Rym: that.".

296
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:44,519
Rym: So I didn't.

297
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,740
Rym: And then I actually applied to a bunch of jobs doing tech writing, like for websites and blogs and things.

298
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,760
Scott: Oh yeah, just for SEO dudes or whatever.

299
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,200
Rym: Well, yeah, basically.

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,860
Rym: Those sites that review a million cell phones and all that garbage.

301
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,420
Rym: And I actually ghost wrote a bunch of articles in different places that got published.

302
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:04,079
Rym: But they're those shitty articles about phones that you read.

303
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:08,176
Rym: So it's one of those things probably that started it.

304
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:20,777
Rym: But basically, in my estimation, because I just sent my glass to get fixed, like the foil all bubbled up, and I actually wear my glass almost every time I go out, unless I have a reason not to.

305
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:30,339
Rym: And I still think it's an awesome piece of hardware, but I've realized it's really only awesome for professionals who have a professional use for it.

306
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:40,380
Rym: But all the people who are complaining or "quitting," without exception, they're using it for stupid bullshit or don't understand its capabilities.

307
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,480
Scott: Google Glass, and I've said the same thing for over a year now, it's basically a Bluetooth headset on crack.

308
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:54,879
Scott: If you have a reason by which you would be in a situation where you needed to wear a Bluetooth headset, perhaps on crack, then you wear it.

309
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:03,859
Scott: If you're not in such a situation, I mean, there's no reason not to wear it, but I don't wear it if I'm not in that kind of situation because it's slightly uncomfortable on my right ear.

310
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,820
Rym: Yep, well, see, that's one problem you have that I don't have, because I have to wear glasses anyway.

311
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,759
Rym: It's no less comfortable than my existing glasses.

312
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,279
Scott: Well, the thing is, I would wear my sunglasses all day if that wasn't strange to other people.

313
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,640
Rym: You should totally wear your sunglasses all day.

314
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:24,960
Scott: But the reason is my sunglasses attach to my head by squeezing inwards like a crab claw, pincing against my head sideways.

315
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,340
Scott: Google Glass stays on my head by resting down on the top of my ear, putting weight onto my lobe, which hurts over time.

316
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,440
Rym: Good glasses distribute the pressing, the crushing, the pushing, and the pinching all together and make it just a nice feeling.

317
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,398
Scott: Yeah, no, the Google Glass on the right side with the battery puts some weight on the ear.

318
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,720
Scott: So if I wear it for an extended period, it's not the greatest.

319
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Scott: But, you know, if it wasn't for that, you know, it's a bluesy.

320
00:18:50,322 --> 00:19:01,399
Rym: But, like, every failed project almost that I see about Glass and, like, everyone's, like, actual complaints about it boil down to people who really, like, the fuck did you think this thing was going to do?

321
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Rym: Did you even look at the specs?

322
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:11,911
Rym: Like, why, like, OpenTable and Facebook, like, there's nothing to fucking do with those kinds of apps and Google Glass.

323
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:12,620
Rym: that would be useful.

324
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,059
Rym: Maybe Facebook, like, messengers stuff, but that's it.

325
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,540
Rym: A lot of people are trying to watch videos on it.

326
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,999
Rym: They're trying to, like, record video on it.

327
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:23,399
Rym: It's like, you know what it's for?

328
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:27,499
Rym: So my battery doesn't run out at conventions when I'm using my phone to talk to people.

329
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:36,098
Scott: So I can take a picture if both my hands are full so I can, you know, see who's calling me and decide to pick up or not without having to, you know, if I'm not wearing a Pebble watch.

330
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:44,820
Rym: Yeah, like, I imagine all the staff at a fan convention, like, if all of them were wearing a Google Glass, like, that would make running a convention a million dodgies.

331
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,778
Scott: Yeah, we don't need to all have walkie-talkies and shit with little headsets on them.

332
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:57,319
Rym: You have a Google Hangout, plus you can just talk to each other, and if, you know, crazy guy shit goes down, all the staffers involved just start recording what's going on while they deal with it.

333
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,160
Rym: So there's no possibility of future drama.

334
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:05,199
Scott: It has many uses, none of which are uses that a lot of people tried to do with it.

335
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,080
Rym: So I suspect that the long-term push of this, because Google's not going to give up.

336
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,198
Rym: They've put too much into it, and even though they've lost a lot of-- Sun cost fallacy?

337
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:20,979
Rym: Yeah, they're not going to give up on it yet, and if they do, they're going to give up on it in a very long-- They're giving it to Taco Bell employees.

338
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,160
Rym: And slow fashion.

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,480
Rym: I think it's going to be shifted and focus more on a professional market.

340
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,860
Rym: They're going to go after, like, doctors.

341
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,019
Scott: They've already done that.

342
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Rym: Yeah, I think they're going to really focus on that now, but I think they're going to give up on the mass-market consumer side, at least until they have a different, like, a fundamentally different hardware.

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Scott: Why don't we make an app that is for the professional market?

344
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:50,178
Scott: I can think of-- So I already imagine, because they're putting-- You put an app on there, so it's like, if you're a doctor, it tells you what room you have to be in.

345
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:51,880
Rym: It's got the app I envisioned already.

346
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,079
Rym: I envision the "I am a train conductor" app.

347
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,400
Scott: Of an orchestra?

348
00:20:59,181 --> 00:20:59,939
Rym: Train conductor.

349
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:00,940
Scott: Oh, choo-choo?

350
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:19,000
Rym: Yeah, it combines the video of "go for it" guy, coupled with-- The conductor is able to coordinate everything on the fly, and see the schedule, and see delays, and communicate all that information that right now, usually, they use their semi-secret, terrible old intercom to communicate.

351
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,839
Rym: Just put, like, a Wi-Fi on the train just for them.

352
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,997
Scott: You can look at tickets, and it can be like,

353
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:24,239
Scott: "Ding!"

354
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:26,360
Scott: And then you can see if, you know, ticket's legit.

355
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:26,865
Rym: Yep.

356
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Rym: Those are the kinds of things Glass can do really well.

357
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:34,960
Scott: You can take a picture, then he can reference the picture, and see who's new on that train, and ask them for their ticket.

358
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,239
Scott: Of course, conductors seem to be able to remember that pretty well.

359
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:37,779
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,998
Scott: I don't know if they need the help with that.

361
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:50,620
Rym: But I can imagine a lot of, like, really awesome professional uses, but to be honest, other than for ultra-nerds, I can envision very few, like, mass-market consumer uses, which I'm fine with.

362
00:21:51,021 --> 00:22:02,479
Rym: If the entire developer community of Glass moves more toward professional applications, that benefits me, as someone who has Glass way more than I care about all the consumers who might want something like this.

363
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,882
Rym: So, things of the day, Sean!

364
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:20,143
Rym: So, there's a game called Heavy Rain, and it's one of those shitty movie games that we hate, but it had an epic glitch.

365
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:28,569
Rym: that's so rare, this is a video of a bunch of people, like, videoing the screen, because it happened, and half of it is them laughing so hard they can hardly breathe, and it's pretty funny.

366
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,524
Rym: Basically, it's, you know that game, you see the screenshot of, there's a funeral, and it's like, "Press X to pay your

367
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:36,168
Rym: respects.".

368
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:41,930
Scott: I can imagine such a game, which is actually just a movie that pretends to be a game, by making you occasionally push buttons.

369
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,209
Rym: Oh, funny, funny like that.

370
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:45,274
Scott: But I have never seen such a game before.

371
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:46,689
Scott: you showed me your thing of the day before the show.

372
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:47,689
Rym: They exist.

373
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:56,849
Rym: So, at the end of this game, there's a scene where, like, there's this kid, and you're, like, rescuing him from a serial killer or something, and at one point, like, you can hit X to yell the kid's name.

374
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:59,024
Rym: So, you're doing a thing, you're like, "Sean!

375
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,124
Rym: Sean!"

376
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:02,350
Rym: And the model, like, does it, like, it's a movie scene.

377
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,870
Rym: And I guess that's cool and immersive, and also kind of stupid, but whatever.

378
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:07,268
Scott: But if you don't press it?

379
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,730
Rym: Nothing happens, I guess.

380
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,550
Rym: I don't know, I haven't played the game, and I never will.

381
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:14,528
Rym: But it's only supposed to be during this scene, eventually, like, you save the kid.

382
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:15,764
Rym: Spoilers.

383
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:22,250
Rym: And then the entire end sequence of the movie happens, which is one of those, like, quick time event action things.

384
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:30,069
Rym: The game glitched out, and you can keep hitting X, and the character's model will turn and yell,

385
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,211
Rym: "Sean!"

386
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,669
Rym: no matter when you hit the button.

387
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:38,330
Rym: Throughout this entire many minute long cinematic scene.

388
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:39,950
Rym: Shit's hilarious.

389
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,150
Rym: It gets to a point.

390
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,444
Scott: Imagine watching Lord of the Rings, but then you push X for him to be like, "You shall not

391
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:47,770
Scott: pass.".

392
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,508
Scott: And it's like, he's not even there, and it's just like...

393
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,167
Rym: Like, suddenly you hear him in the distance, like, "You shall not...".

394
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,828
Rym: At one point, the character who yells

395
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,050
Rym: "Sean!"

396
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,290
Rym: is not on screen anymore.

397
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,550
Rym: Like, he's off down somewhere else, because you're following these other characters.

398
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,669
Rym: And if you hit it, you hear him yelling in the distance.

399
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,161
Scott: So, "What's taters?

400
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,007
Scott: You shall not

401
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:08,249
Scott: pass.".

402
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,027
Rym: Wow, I kind of want that game now.

403
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:15,629
Rym: So yeah, this is actually pretty funny.

404
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,770
Scott: Okay, so these dudes in Australia went to Japan, because I guess they were nerdy, wanted to go on vacation.

405
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,870
Rym: That's a good vacation.

406
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,870
Scott: And it's very close to them.

407
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,050
Scott: If we lived in Australia, man, we can go to Japan all the time.

408
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,749
Rym: Pretty often.

409
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,570
Scott: We can go there as often as we go to Florida.

410
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,928
Rym: Anyway... Okay, I just want to say, Scott, you know what the first comment on this video you're about to describe is?

411
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:35,670
Rym: The ride of a lifetime.

412
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:36,366
Scott: That's true.

413
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:44,390
Scott: So, they went to Japan, and they went to the Japanese Game Center, where there's all kinds of pachinkos and other things of that nature.

414
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:47,530
Scott: And they found a machine to put money into.

415
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,908
Scott: And I guess it wasn't that much money, so they decided to put money into it.

416
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:52,170
Scott: And they just went with it.

417
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,810
Scott: So this machine, it's a typical machine where you're putting coins in the coin, and there's a pusher, and the pusher pushes the coins along, right?

418
00:24:58,892 --> 00:24:59,709
Scott: And then shit happens.

419
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:02,750
Scott: And the shit that happens is a video slot machine.

420
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,209
Scott: So you put enough coins, it pushes coins, and the slot machine rolls, and stuff happens.

421
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,749
Scott: There are also balls, big rubber balls, that are in there, and they can get pushed off the edge, too.

422
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:17,449
Scott: When one of those gets pushed off the edge, even crazier stuff happens.

423
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:19,469
Scott: And it escalates.

424
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:20,869
Scott: And escalates.

425
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:29,748
Scott: And this machine, I don't know who made this, like who designed it, I'm really, really fucking curious as to who made this thing, everything that went into it.

426
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,569
Scott: But these Australian dudes, they just fucking go with it.

427
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,090
Scott: And they just keep putting money in, and seeing all the crazy shit, and they get hooked on it.

428
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,470
Rym: I'm amazed at the sheer number of physical objects that move.

429
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,608
Scott: They put so much effort into it, and you gotta watch this video to the end.

430
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,109
Scott: Just keep watching it.

431
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,989
Scott: They edited it really well, so it's as short as it can be.

432
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,350
Scott: This machine is fucking incredible.

433
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,009
Scott: Thank you for saving me the trouble of ever playing this machine in my entire life.

434
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,550
Scott: I can just see this, and I'm good.

435
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:04,169
Rym: My favorite moment is when the camera pans down, and the one guy's just like leaning his forehead down, because he can't deal with it anymore.

436
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:08,370
Scott: You must see the glory of this arcade machine.

437
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:11,330
Scott: Why do we just have stupid shitty cranes and crap?

438
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,230
Scott: If we had these things, I might have been coerced into dumping a bunch of money at least once in my life.

439
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,169
Rym: You know, I wonder, because Wildwood's Boardwalk, has been getting increasingly lame, if you just had one of these motherfuckers.

440
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,030
Scott: No, we just bought one of those empty spots.

441
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,629
Scott: No, but in the view I would do- And put in a bunch of shit just like this.

442
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,229
Rym: You know what I would do?

443
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:33,150
Rym: I'd buy one of those spots, because it can't be expensive on that boardwalk anymore.

444
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:33,929
Scott: No, it can't be.

445
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:40,469
Rym: I would have an arcade, and it just has one of these machines on a little stage in the middle, and that's it.

446
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,570
Scott: That's the whole room?

447
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:48,669
Rym: That's the whole room, and you pay, basically you have to pay to go up there to even like be on the stage, and it's more like a spectator event.

448
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,869
Scott: Yeah, I think you just fill it with these things.

449
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:55,110
Scott: Get one of every crazy Japan machine, you know, and just let people go.

450
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,610
Rym: Get the old like weird stuff like that finger butt game.

451
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,629
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure you can go to a game center, and like they're putting in new pachinko machines when they come out.

452
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,810
Scott: They're getting rid of old ones, you know.

453
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,569
Scott: You can get a lot of old used machines from them.

454
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,170
Scott: You'd pay for shipping once, and then the shipping will pay for itself eventually.

455
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,749
Rym: Yeah, you can make some money, I think.

456
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:18,061
Scott: Because I mean like the old machines that the game centers are moving today will be incredible for the U.S.

457
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:19,027
Scott: today, right?

458
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:22,489
Scott: And maybe buy one brand new machine.

459
00:27:23,453 --> 00:27:29,430
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is Watership Down, the famous book about rabbits by Richard Adams.

460
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:31,670
Rym: I got past the cult rabbits.

461
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,890
Rym: I really like the cult rabbits.

462
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:33,767
Scott: Didn't even start yet.

463
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,310
Rym: Yeah, there's cultist rabbits, Scott.

464
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,849
Scott: The society rabbits, I mean.

465
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:39,790
Scott: Society rabbits.

466
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,609
Rym: And yeah, I hear there seem to be some more rabbits coming, and there seems to be some trouble going down now.

467
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,130
Rym: What's mostly about rabbits?

468
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,028
Scott: No kidding.

469
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:56,190
Rym: We don't have any conventions until PAX South in San Antonio, and then PAX East in Boston.

470
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,269
Rym: If you didn't buy tickets to PAX East, well, fuck you, they're sold out.

471
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,490
Rym: They were sold out a long time ago.

472
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:00,824
Rym: Too late.

473
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,450
Rym: And if you failed to get tickets, it's your own fault.

474
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:11,410
Rym: There were Friday, Saturday, and Sunday badges available for hours after the badges went on sale.

475
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,550
Scott: Now, you couldn't get a three-day.

476
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,150
Scott: The three-day passes sold out in like seven minutes.

477
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,190
Rym: But three-day badges are basically mythical.

478
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,190
Scott: You had a three-hour time window in which you could have bought a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday pass, which is just a more expensive three-day pass.

479
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,247
Rym: And if you think, "Oh, but they could distribute these badges a better

480
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:26,469
Rym: way."

481
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:27,670
Rym: One, fuck you.

482
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:36,209
Rym: Two, I outlined every possible way they could distribute those badges in our forum and describe why every one of them is worse than how they do it now.

483
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,409
Scott: Also, they sold out.

484
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,750
Scott: So why should they change anything?

485
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,970
Scott: They made the maximum amount of money they could possibly make.

486
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,869
Rym: Well, if they raise the price, they can make more money.

487
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:47,050
Scott: Yeah, but without going against their principles.

488
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,807
Rym: Oh, yep, yep.

489
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,510
Rym: First principles.

490
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,310
Rym: So yeah, watch our YouTube videos.

491
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,676
Rym: GeekNights Presents.

492
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,170
Rym: Utena is returning soon.

493
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:58,349
Rym: Just hold your horses and Jesus, stop emailing me about it.

494
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,470
Scott: How many emails do you have?

495
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,026
Rym: I've gotten...

496
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,328
Scott: All right, you're in your Gmail right now.

497
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,309
Scott: Search for Utena.

498
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:03,750
Scott: I want to see how many results there are.

499
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,489
Rym: So I've gotten, I believe, three emails about it and I've gotten four or five YouTube Plus.

500
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,645
Scott: Your Amazon, your Amazon, me, me, me, Emily, me, me.

501
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:16,350
Rym: Maybe there's plus notifications.

502
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,150
Rym: Let me try to find these plus ones.

503
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,950
Rym: How can I search for just my plus notifications?

504
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:22,389
Scott: Just search for Utena.

505
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,446
Rym: That's not... God damn it.

506
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,330
Rym: How do I even... I will try to find out how many I've gotten.

507
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,189
Rym: Less than 10, more than five.

508
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,450
Rym: People have bothered me about it.

509
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,770
Scott: Oh, look, there's people named Utena.

510
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,063
Scott: Hello.

511
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:41,829
Scott: Oh, there's actual Utena.

512
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,143
Scott: Hello.

513
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,529
Rym: Oh, Utena Tenjou.

514
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:45,349
Rym: What's going on here?

515
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:47,479
Rym: She's got 109 followers.

516
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,529
Scott: What did she do today?

517
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:51,310
Rym: Is that a bunch of her in space?

518
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,890
Scott: That's an amazing art.

519
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,509
Scott: I wish I had the full res for my wallpaper.

520
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:55,090
Rym: Oh, my God.

521
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,228
Rym: I'm going to find out what that's from.

522
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:57,488
Rym: That's pretty good.

523
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,209
Scott: All right.

524
00:29:58,835 --> 00:29:59,350
Rym: Oh, it's Russian.

525
00:29:59,470 --> 00:29:59,788
Rym: Check it out.

526
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,329
Rym: Whoever this person is is Russian.

527
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,289
Scott: Utena is Russian?

528
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:03,610
Scott: Sweet.

529
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,350
Rym: But it's a picture of Utena Tenjou.

530
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:06,769
Rym: That's a good Utena.

531
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:07,488
Rym: Oh, she's playing it.

532
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:08,610
Rym: Oh, this is really good.

533
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:09,147
Rym: All right.

534
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,268
Rym: We found a good thing here.

535
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,429
Rym: So, yeah.

536
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,468
Rym: Anyway, other meta items.

537
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:22,690
Scott: You should go to the internet in all those places such as Google Plus, Facebook, Twitter, IRC, et cetera, et cetera.

538
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,589
Scott: We have a newsletter every place.

539
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,547
Scott: We are there.

540
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,189
Scott: We are there for you.

541
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,788
Scott: Go on the internet and find us.

542
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,289
Scott: If you're listening to this already, you probably don't need to know that, but maybe tell your friend.

543
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,070
Rym: So I need to buy a new smartphone.

544
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,948
Rym: At least I thought I did.

545
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,769
Scott: Why do you need to?

546
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,630
Scott: What's wrong with the one you got?

547
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:40,486
Rym: Exactly.

548
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,929
Rym: That's where this came down to.

549
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:52,688
Rym: So I was trying to decide if I was going to buy or were going to buy a smartphone right now, November of 2014, right after a generation of cell phones came out.

550
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,850
Rym: So new generation, like all the new stuff is out.

551
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,630
Rym: We're past like a peak of new stuff appearing.

552
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,613
Rym: New stuff won't appear again for a while, though.

553
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:06,770
Rym: actually I just saw a leak that Sony might have a Z4 that's going to be announced in January.

554
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,010
Scott: Their Xperia Z whatevers are getting popular.

555
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,189
Scott: So they seem to be cranking them out.

556
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,229
Scott: Like they finally got a wedge in there.

557
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:12,830
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,950
Scott: And sort of the gap left by some of the other phone manufacturers.

559
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:20,010
Scott: So they're milking it for all it's worth because Sony is not doing too well in the big picture.

560
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,527
Scott: No, they're not.

561
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,230
Scott: Some of their, I mean, that's sort of always been Sony's story.

562
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:30,869
Scott: They always have some department of Sony, some, you know, because they're so huge that's doing successfully and a lot of other parts that are just taking a hit.

563
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:36,149
Scott: And so whenever one part of Sony starts doing well, they're like, oh my God, this milk that for all it's worth.

564
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,730
Rym: So I, you know, because occasionally, like what if your smartphone dies?

565
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,330
Rym: So I decided to figure out if my smartphone died today, what would I immediately just buy on the Internet?

566
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:50,617
Rym: And in doing my research, they're like, it's not even like.

567
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,710
Rym: there aren't small smartphones.

568
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,110
Rym: There aren't even normal sized smartphones anymore.

569
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,642
Rym: The iPhone six is the second smallest smartphone you can buy.

570
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:01,249
Rym: that's modern.

571
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:01,416
Rym: Yeah.

572
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,469
Scott: The iPhone six also, now that I've had it, it is too big.

573
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:06,143
Rym: Uh, yeah.

574
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:08,329
Scott: And that's not even the plus.

575
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:10,349
Scott: I just like, I'm going to do it.

576
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:16,090
Scott: Like when the iPhone six is done in two years, I will not get anything that is this size or larger.

577
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,390
Scott: I'm going to find something smaller.

578
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,270
Rym: So guess what?

579
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,510
Rym: Guess how many smartphones there are that are smaller, that are within a current generation or two.

580
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,427
Scott: iPhone five S.

581
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:25,426
Rym: Yes.

582
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:31,370
Rym: You can get the previous iPhone or you can get the Sony Z3 compact.

583
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:32,029
Scott: Yup.

584
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:33,425
Rym: Not the regular Sony Z3.

585
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,610
Rym: The regular Sony Z3 is a fucking monster.

586
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,029
Rym: The compact is actually smaller than the iPhone six.

587
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:40,546
Scott: Yup.

588
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,850
Rym: It's like a millimeter, half a millimeter.

589
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,250
Rym: But is that screen a retina screen?

590
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:47,950
Rym: It's super high res, but I don't think it's as high res.

591
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:49,769
Rym: It is really high res though.

592
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,650
Rym: Basically everything about the Sony Z3 compact is perfect.

593
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:55,329
Rym: Except one.

594
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,770
Rym: It's still a fucking monster.

595
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,150
Rym: It's just the smallest of the monsters.

596
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,310
Rym: Like it's the smallest Titan, but it's still a Titan.

597
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,790
Scott: iPhone nano is coming.

598
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,506
Scott: They're going to save us.

599
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,688
Scott: This fucking have faith.

600
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:11,590
Rym: The Z3 compact, compact, it's called the compact.

601
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:18,550
Rym: It's the small boutique version is bigger than any cell phone I have ever owned in my life.

602
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:20,669
Scott: iPhone four, come back.

603
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,029
Rym: I know my God.

604
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,129
Rym: Watch these people.

605
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,889
Rym: So the only problems with it, other than that, it's too big on an objective scale, but it's the smallest one.

606
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,330
Rym: So leaving that aside, one it's Sony.

607
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:35,130
Rym: Two, it's not stock Android.

608
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:35,910
Scott: Nope.

609
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:38,167
Scott: So they have promised you.

610
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,410
Rym: I guess you could, uh, I saw some people had some trouble because Sony, so I'm curious about that.

611
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,009
Rym: I'm sure there's good.

612
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,350
Scott: It's never going to be easy, but I know someone that's antigen though.

613
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:50,668
Rym: They did promise.

614
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:56,130
Rym: Sony did say openly in writing that lollipop will drop on them soon.

615
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,050
Rym: The ROM stuff was announced.

616
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,749
Rym: Like it's, it is possible to run lollipop on them.

617
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:05,690
Rym: If I buy one, I'm going to wait until lollipop drops and wait to see if it works.

618
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:08,149
Scott: That's the kind of shit you never had to worry about with iOS.

619
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,750
Rym: That's also the kind of shit you never have to worry about with a stock Android phone.

620
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,789
Scott: Oh, you mean the only one, which is the nexus.

621
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:22,909
Scott: My coworker has been desperately trying to buy the nexus six, the biggest of the big, why not just buy a pizza stone?

622
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,121
Scott: Why not just buy an iPad mini?

623
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,329
Rym: Why not just carry around a surface pro?

624
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:32,648
Scott: Why not?

625
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:37,609
Scott: So with a Bluetooth headset, seriously put it in your bag.

626
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,850
Scott: So, uh, you know what?

627
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:43,549
Scott: This actually makes Google glass a better, right?

628
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,989
Scott: Bigger phones are a better case for Google glass because your phone is so big.

629
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,790
Rym: You leave it in your best.

630
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,630
Scott: Never want to like carry it or you can put it in a messenger bag instead of a pocket.

631
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:56,969
Scott: And Google glass can basically mean that you hardly ever have to open that messenger bag and get it.

632
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,289
Rym: And then that screen's never on.

633
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,149
Rym: So that battery will last like a week.

634
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,229
Scott: I mean, it basically is a battery and it's a battery and a radio.

635
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:06,610
Rym: And occasionally you'll pull it out to watch a movie on it.

636
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,570
Rym: When you're stuck on a bus somewhere playing Hearthstone.

637
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:11,609
Rym: So not stock.

638
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,250
Rym: Android's actually a big problem for me, but there are no reasonable options.

639
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,610
Rym: Hardware wise that runs stock Android.

640
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:21,490
Rym: The four is the smallest nexus.

641
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:23,229
Rym: And that's what I have now.

642
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,490
Rym: The five is bigger.

643
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:30,568
Rym: So it's already worse, not faster or better in any other way.

644
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:31,090
Rym: that matters.

645
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,210
Rym: In fact, the only difference I can see is that one had a huge camera bug.

646
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,950
Scott: What about that Moto X thing people like?

647
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,190
Rym: It's fucking gigantic.

648
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,368
Scott: Oh, all righty then.

649
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:39,837
Rym: Yeah.

650
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:45,447
Rym: I cut out cardboard like versions of every phone size to like.

651
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:46,010
Rym: try them out.

652
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:48,430
Rym: And they're like, they're monsters.

653
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,208
Rym: Like they're jokes.

654
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,450
Rym: Like if you went back four years and made a video parodying people with big like giant phones.

655
00:35:55,812 --> 00:36:01,309
Rym: And you like, if you made a video and showed people using the phones of today four years ago, you would think it was a joke.

656
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,870
Rym: Uh, it's waterproof, like completely waterproof.

657
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:10,190
Scott: Like take it under water, like throw it in the ocean and take it out of the ocean.

658
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,584
Rym: Yes.

659
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,508
Rym: What?

660
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,230
Rym: Actually, I think the nexus, the new one is also waterproof.

661
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:16,930
Rym: Like all the new smartphones are water.

662
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,890
Scott: Like I can put it into it, submerge it fully in my bathtub.

663
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,190
Scott: Let it sit there for 10 minutes.

664
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,819
Rym: Put my hand on 30, 30 minutes, 30 minutes.

665
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,668
Rym: Scott, look, here's the pictures they're marketing it with.

666
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,350
Rym: All right.

667
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:29,649
Rym: Just underwater.

668
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,770
Scott: Stay take it to the ocean and see if that fucking happens.

669
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,150
Scott: And then the day after you buy it.

670
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:43,130
Rym: So the warranty is still there here, here, uh, in compliance with IP six, five, six, really good, except it's really big protected against the ingress of dust and is waterproof.

671
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:53,810
Rym: Uh, dust tide protected against low pressure jets of water from all practiceable directions can be kept under five feet of fresh water for up to fresh water.

672
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,809
Scott: Stay away from the ocean.

673
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:55,305
Rym: Yeah.

674
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:57,810
Rym: So that's cool.

675
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,989
Rym: But other phones are able to do this without anything fiddly.

676
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:06,790
Rym: The Z three compact has little doors over the USB port.

677
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:08,809
Rym: So you have to open this little door.

678
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,070
Scott: And if you open the door and bring it in the water, you're in trouble.

679
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:12,210
Rym: It's not waterproof.

680
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,730
Scott: If the doors open, that door is something that's going to break.

681
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:21,608
Rym: Apparently the door feels really fragile and people are really worried about it, but it seems to actually not break.

682
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:24,870
Rym: Granted, the phone's new, so we'll see how long that lasts.

683
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,570
Scott: I mean, there's a reason that they never put little doors and shit like that on Apple devices ever.

684
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:30,730
Scott: Right.

685
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:31,429
Rym: Little doors.

686
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,830
Scott: How come other people don't just learn that fucking lesson?

687
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,387
Scott: I don't get it.

688
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,290
Scott: It's like there are things that Apple does well.

689
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,689
Scott: You can just fucking copy them.

690
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,910
Rym: So basically because the iPhone six is just actually too big.

691
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:43,730
Rym: I've ruled it out.

692
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:49,590
Rym: I can't, I would, I would buy an iPhone five S if I had to buy an iPhone, I would not buy the six.

693
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:50,549
Scott: Nothing wrong with it.

694
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,530
Rym: So then I did the second analysis.

695
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:56,450
Rym: Would I be better off just buying another nexus four?

696
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,810
Rym: Cause you can get those things wrong.

697
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,930
Scott: Well, you have a nexus four though.

698
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,889
Scott: Why would you buy a nexus four?

699
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,470
Rym: Well, if it broke, if I had to buy a phone right now, are you going to break it on purpose?

700
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,010
Scott: Did you give an excuse to buy a new phone?

701
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:11,628
Rym: No, because the answer to go to move the answer just, that's a, how would that, why would I ever do that?

702
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:12,869
Scott: You do that often.

703
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,389
Rym: When have I ever done that?

704
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:17,430
Rym: I'm really sad that my TS fat broke.

705
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:18,510
Scott: You broke on purpose.

706
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,670
Scott: You could buy a new DS without feeling guilty.

707
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,210
Rym: I wish I still had my DS fat cause that's some serious fucking street crap.

708
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:25,440
Rym: Yeah.

709
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,950
Rym: And it kind of is, even though that screen was kind of meh.

710
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:30,309
Scott: It wasn't meh the day we got it.

711
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,008
Rym: No, it wasn't.

712
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,590
Rym: The worst thing is it broke while I was playing Pokemon.

713
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:35,568
Scott: Not advanced wars.

714
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,070
Rym: No.

715
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:39,390
Rym: Well, I'd already beaten every possible advanced wars at that point.

716
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:47,590
Rym: So if I had to buy a smartphone today, based on all of my research, I would buy another nexus four.

717
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,950
Rym: Because the only disadvantage of the nexus four is it will never run lollipop.

718
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:52,745
Rym: It's too old.

719
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,590
Scott: Oh, really?

720
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:53,864
Rym: Yeah.

721
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,010
Rym: It's the five will get lollipops supposedly, but the four will not.

722
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,488
Scott: What does lollipop do that?

723
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,470
Rym: According to Steve Pomeroy, it's amazing.

724
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,828
Scott: What came before lollipop?

725
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,629
Rym: A Kit Kat for four.

726
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:05,950
Scott: So what's the difference?

727
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:06,810
Rym: I don't know.

728
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,489
Rym: I haven't done any.

729
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,087
Rym: I didn't look into that too much, but people I trust like Steve Pomeroy, it's cool.

730
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:13,649
Scott: All right.

731
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,570
Rym: He actually was like, it's really cool.

732
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,189
Rym: Have you seen it?

733
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,748
Rym: I was like, no, but now I really want to.

734
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:19,389
Scott: What can it possibly be on there?

735
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,990
Rym: But what people seem to say is that they've fixed almost all of Android's long running UX problems.

736
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:40,289
Rym: And the overwhelming sentiment on the internet is basically that it's not better than iOS, but the getting better momentum is growing and it's getting better faster than iOS.

737
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,469
Scott: Which iOS doesn't really have any room to grow.

738
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,910
Rym: Yeah, that's a very subjective thing.

739
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:57,410
Rym: But seriously, the only problems, the Nexus 4 is the best phone to buy right now because one, it still runs stock Android and Kit Kat is fine for most people.

740
00:39:58,234 --> 00:39:59,349
Rym: It's plenty fast.

741
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,050
Rym: It's so fast that no, there's like, I tried a bunch of other phones in stores.

742
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,030
Rym: Nothing's faster except games.

743
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,429
Rym: I don't play that many games on my phone.

744
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:08,629
Rym: Like Google maps.

745
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,870
Rym: All this stuff I do is equally fast as far as humans are concerned.

746
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:16,828
Rym: The only drawback in the world is that it does not support 4G.

747
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,069
Rym: It only supports H.G.S.P.A plus, which you know what?

748
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:23,330
Rym: Is actually fast enough unless you're uploading a lot.

749
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,450
Scott: But I mean, I watch YouTube videos sometimes.

750
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:29,050
Rym: So do I. H.G.S.P.A is plenty fast down.

751
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,210
Rym: It's problem is it's asymmetric, so you don't have a lot of upstream.

752
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:33,713
Rym: Hmm.

753
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:42,770
Rym: So I'm not going to upgrade my phone because the Nexus 4 is the best Android phone available today.

754
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,090
Scott: And then your phone's going to break and you won't be able to get a Nexus 4.

755
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,010
Rym: Let me see if I can buy another Nexus 4 from Google directly.

756
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:49,230
Rym: I didn't mean today.

757
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,270
Scott: I meant in the future.

758
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,470
Rym: Well, in the future, I'm hoping I'm going to try to hold out until another generation of phones comes out.

759
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:57,906
Scott: I got two.

760
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,388
Scott: Oh shit.

761
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,598
Rym: Lollipop announced for Nexus 4.

762
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:01,968
Scott: There you go.

763
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:03,209
Rym: Yeah, fuck yeah.

764
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:03,887
Rym: All right.

765
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,490
Rym: The best smartphone on the market today is the Nexus 4.

766
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,390
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

767
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:09,562
Rym: Or maybe the iPhone 5S.

768
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,470
Scott: Hopefully in two years we'll have iPhone Nano.

769
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,069
Rym: Well, I'm hoping because it seems like...

770
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,710
Scott: If they come out with iPhone Nano in one year, I'm going to be hella pissed.

771
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:25,509
Rym: From what I can gather, the Z3 compact was kind of like not aimed at a U.S.

772
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,850
Rym: market.

773
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,470
Rym: Like that's aimed more at like Japan and other countries.

774
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,888
Scott: Don't they like even bigger phones than the U.S.

775
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:31,110
Scott: people?

776
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:33,009
Rym: They also like the tiny boutique phones.

777
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,649
Rym: They'll always have the big version and the compact version.

778
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,427
Rym: So the compact, from what I've read, was not intended to be marketed heavily in the

779
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:40,809
Rym: U.S.,

780
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:50,010
Rym: but I get the impression that the Xperia is selling way better than anything they've ever made in recent memory, and the compact is selling way more than they expected.

781
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,310
Rym: So my hope against hope is that a Z4 or a Z5 compact...

782
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,930
Scott: Someone will realize, "Hey, there's actually a market for a phone that's not ginormous.

783
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,684
Scott: Maybe we should make

784
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:57,928
Scott: some.".

785
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:02,605
Rym: If I were Sony, my Z4 or Z5, I would have two options of every phone.

786
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,249
Rym: A phablet version and a compact version.

787
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,610
Rym: Because I think the part of phones that disappeared was the small ones.

788
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,070
Rym: I think what actually needs to disappear in the market is the current sized ones.

789
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:25,790
Rym: You either need to go like iPhone 6 Plus or compact, and I think that middle ground between those two is actually the one that has the least real market appeal.

790
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:26,308
Scott: Yep.

791
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:32,831
Rym: And to all the people who said that their Nexus 4 is too slow, the fuck are you doing on your Nexus 4?

792
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,890
Scott: Man, okay, so like my co-workers, right?

793
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,410
Scott: The one that's buying the Nexus 6.

794
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,450
Rym: I took a Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 next to each other in the T-Mobile store and did a bunch of stuff.

795
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:43,870
Rym: There is literally no difference in responsiveness.

796
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:49,500
Scott: As like the co-worker that's buying a Nexus 6, it's like they're all saying, "Oh, you can't use iOS.

797
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,287
Scott: It doesn't do all this

798
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:50,570
Scott: stuff.".

799
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,287
Scott: And I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing on your

800
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:52,550
Scott: phone?".

801
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:53,628
Scott: You know?

802
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:02,289
Scott: And he's like, "Well, I got all these videos on my NAS at home, and I want to be able to download those videos onto my phone and watch

803
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:02,489
Scott: them.".

804
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:03,970
Rym: iTunes, Handbrake, whatever.

805
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,670
Rym: Like it's not rocket science.

806
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,070
Scott: No, that's so much work to be like iTunes, Handbrake, whatever.

807
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:13,810
Rym: It's not like it's easy to watch videos on your Android phone.

808
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:21,687
Scott: They're like, "Well, the video player can just play any old videos, so I just dump them all on the SD card and I carry around my video library on my

809
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:22,089
Scott: phone.".

810
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,130
Scott: All right.

811
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:28,026
Scott: It's like, and then I use just like this, you know, free video player software, and it's like,

812
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:28,210
Scott: "Whoa.".

813
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:30,069
Scott: So the reason, right?

814
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,090
Scott: So it's like, why?

815
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,850
Scott: First of all, what are you doing to eat to watch these videos on your phone?

816
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,126
Scott: He's like, "Don't you watch a movie on the

817
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:36,430
Scott: subway?".

818
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:45,209
Scott: And I'm like, "No, I don't watch 90-minute long feature films on my 15-minute subway ride, nor do I watch 15 minutes of a 90-minute movie at any point in my

819
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:45,370
Scott: life.".

820
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:45,770
Scott: You know what?

821
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,950
Scott: If I'm gonna watch a movie, I sit the fuck down and concentrate fully on that movie.

822
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:51,550
Rym: You know what I watch on my commute?

823
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:55,510
Rym: Things that are about as long as my commute, meaning one episode of an anime.

824
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,970
Scott: I listen to a podcast, which I could do with the oldest possible iPod.

825
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,289
Rym: I can listen to half of a Dave and Joel on the way to work, and the other half on the way from work.

826
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:09,203
Rym: I can listen to one pseudo-pod story per direction, because they're all about 27 minutes.

827
00:44:12,212 --> 00:44:18,670
Rym: And if I had longer commutes, like if I was in Metro North again, I'd have an iPad and I'd watch stuff on that.

828
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:20,530
Rym: I wouldn't watch it on my phone.

829
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:25,510
Scott: So it's like, people are just doing weird things, which is creating a demand for weird stuff, right?

830
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:31,370
Scott: It's like, my philosophy is don't change your technology, change yourself.

831
00:44:32,474 --> 00:44:33,568
Scott: Changing you is free.

832
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,250
Scott: Changing computers and technology takes a lot of time and pain in the ass-ness.

833
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,849
Rym: Well, well, well.

834
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,349
Rym: So here's the real issue, I think.

835
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:49,950
Rym: The things people use computer technology for are starting to diverge, like in the last five or six years, way rapidly.

836
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:58,750
Rym: And the people who primarily consume media versus the people who do pretty much anything else, those are the two use cases of computers now.

837
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,370
Rym: That has nothing to do with the form factor, where, how, battery, anything.

838
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,230
Rym: No one thinks about like, I need a small device on the go and a big device at home.

839
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:11,630
Rym: They think solely in terms of I'm consuming media or I'm creating media.

840
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:17,490
Rym: So as a result, people like this, I think, are thinking, I watch movies on my thing.

841
00:45:17,772 --> 00:45:20,010
Rym: Their thing being whatever computing device they use.

842
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,670
Rym: So they buy the biggest smartphone because that's like just their device.

843
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:25,887
Rym: And that's it.

844
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,349
Rym: And then they have a laptop at work.

845
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:36,990
Rym: I know people who are not that much older than us who have a computer at work that they use for work and they do not have a computer at home anymore.

846
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:39,950
Rym: And they are programmers.

847
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,968
Scott: How do they program anything?

848
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:42,968
Rym: They program at work.

849
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,750
Scott: They don't program when they're at home?

850
00:45:46,153 --> 00:45:48,530
Rym: No, unless they have to work from home.

851
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:50,449
Rym: and then they bring the work laptop home.

852
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,409
Scott: What do they do at home?

853
00:45:53,112 --> 00:45:53,502
Rym: I don't know.

854
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,806
Rym: Whatever muggles do at home, like I don't...

855
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,530
Scott: What hobby do they have and how does a... Even if you're not using the computer for programming, because that's just your job, right?

856
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:03,970
Scott: A lawyer might not lawyer at home.

857
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,749
Scott: A dentist doesn't dent at home, right?

858
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,610
Rym: Except a serial killer dentist.

859
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:08,090
Scott: Right.

860
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,510
Scott: So you don't have like a dentist chair in your home unless it's one of those home office dentist things.

861
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:13,849
Rym: Or you're a serial killer.

862
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:28,990
Scott: But even if you are not using the computer to do programming at home, because programming is only a job and not a hobby, a computer, a real computer is essential in assisting absolutely any other worthwhile activity.

863
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,389
Scott: And even, you know, if you're not programming, it will do that in ways that tablets, phones, etc.

864
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,706
Scott: still cannot do.

865
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:41,288
Rym: For a lot of people, the tablet phone does everything they would ever do with a computer at home.

866
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:45,029
Rym: Watch media, look up a recipe, call grandma.

867
00:46:46,797 --> 00:46:47,550
Rym: Look at a website.

868
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,089
Scott: You don't play any PC game ever?

869
00:46:50,994 --> 00:46:52,210
Rym: No, those people don't.

870
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,370
Scott: You don't BitTorrent anything ever, because it's really hard to BitTorrent with just a phone.

871
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:58,570
Scott: Those movies that you're watching.

872
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,329
Rym: I think those people all watch Netflix and Amazon stuff.

873
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:04,470
Rym: Or iTunes.

874
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,529
Scott: There's no website you ever go to.

875
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:09,790
Scott: that is like some content that is not mobile friendly.

876
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:10,628
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

877
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:12,010
Rym: You want to know something really weird?

878
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,669
Rym: I don't know what to make of this.

879
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:26,270
Rym: I suspect a large number of people that we interact with, and maybe even some people we know, very rarely open a web browser and type in a URL.

880
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:30,210
Scott: You never have to type something of any length whatsoever.

881
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:31,848
Rym: Most people don't.

882
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,649
Scott: You never had to like open up a spreadsheet because for some reason.

883
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:40,889
Rym: I've noticed most people don't even use Google Docs.

884
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,690
Scott: I have to use a spreadsheet to order comic books every month, so I need real Excel.

885
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,050
Scott: There's no way I can do that.

886
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,390
Scott: Even with the new Excel for iPad.

887
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:49,190
Rym: No, seriously.

888
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:49,889
Rym: I can't do that.

889
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:58,450
Rym: For ConnectiCon, sure, we use Google Docs for a ton of stuff, but for the actual master schedule layout, I use Excel.

890
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:07,130
Rym: Because it's just like other things don't work very well, and it's not worth the effort to write like an integrated application to do that for a once a year task.

891
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:14,010
Scott: And even though there's Excel on mobile devices, it's going to type on that touch keyboard or plug your iPad into a keyboard.

892
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:19,270
Rym: And I've noticed more and more people buy keyboards to plug into their phones.

893
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,049
Rym: Notice how more and more phones are supporting USB on the go.

894
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:24,268
Rym: Do you know what USB on the go is?

895
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:24,572
Scott: No.

896
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:26,150
Rym: Oh my God.

897
00:48:26,331 --> 00:48:29,030
Rym: It is the most fucking awful thing ever.

898
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:29,787
Rym: Just go look it up.

899
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:33,950
Scott: It's it takes iPads and iPhones to have lightning keyboards.

900
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,849
Scott: Or Bluetooth keyboards.

901
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:36,370
Rym: Yeah.

902
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,829
Rym: So I'm going to see if there's a good quote from the USB on the go.

903
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:43,510
Scott: Is it in a giant?

904
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:44,310
Scott: Oh my God.

905
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,650
Scott: Is it in a monster truck jumping over a USB?

906
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,346
Rym: It has its own Wikipedia page separate from USB.

907
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:54,749
Scott: There's no monster trucks.

908
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,428
Scott: It's supposed to be on the go, isn't it?

909
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:56,824
Scott: Yeah.

910
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,584
Rym: Basically take the unit directionality of USB.

911
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:05,609
Rym: that prevents you from doing stupid things and remove that.

912
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:07,450
Scott: So you can put it in the wrong way?

913
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,550
Rym: Plug it in both directions.

914
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,589
Scott: Oh, and it works both ways.

915
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:10,289
Scott: Yes, that's good.

916
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:14,230
Rym: It is, but it was not very robustly thought out.

917
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,070
Scott: And this was some cables can go in both ways and they were just fine.

918
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:17,709
Rym: Yeah, I know.

919
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:18,186
Rym: You know what?

920
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:28,430
Rym: USB on the go was a bad solution to a problem that already had a solution either by using the existing technology as intended or making a new technology.

921
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:30,810
Rym: Instead, they made this fucking half measure.

922
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,649
Rym: It's read it.

923
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,470
Rym: It's just really sad and I don't like it.

924
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,143
Rym: It was a bad thing.

925
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,009
Rym: I'll link to the Wikipedia article on it.

926
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,983
Scott: Oh, you know, it was too bad that Palm Web OS wireless charging, they got everything right.

927
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,769
Scott: Yeah, except tiny, tiny phone.

928
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,430
Scott: All the apps are perfect.

929
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,789
Rym: You see those pictures I posted?

930
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,586
Rym: I found my Palm Pre because it was in my desk at work when I was putting it next to a big phone.

931
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:53,809
Rym: Oh my God.

932
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:57,590
Scott: It's so tiny and it's perfect as a keyboard.

933
00:49:57,934 --> 00:49:58,950
Rym: It had I don't know.

934
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,629
Rym: I've given up on the physical keyboard.

935
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,490
Scott: Why don't you just get you can get that to work again.

936
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,128
Rym: No, you can't.

937
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,549
Rym: I tried.

938
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:06,150
Scott: So you can find one that was never purchased.

939
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:06,481
Scott: Maybe.

940
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,108
Rym: No, no, no.

941
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:07,769
Rym: Here's the problem.

942
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,930
Rym: To activate it, you need to be able to connect to servers that no longer exist.

943
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:15,969
Rym: It's dead.

944
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:25,670
Rym: There is no way that you could like activate it with a carrier as there are like crazy bootloader things you can do to put it in a mode to that activated.

945
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:32,470
Rym: It uses no loss and trying every one of those applications is probably malware.

946
00:50:33,132 --> 00:50:37,570
Rym: Like the websites of the Palm Pre hobbyist look like dodgy Russian hacking sites.

947
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,029
Rym: I don't trust that shit and I'm just not it.

948
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:45,050
Scott: Why don't we do something about that for five people that will want it?

949
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,130
Rym: The thing is, the Palm Pre is too out of date.

950
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:49,468
Rym: The process, it was too slow.

951
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,890
Scott: You should just start a fucking phone manufacturer.

952
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,810
Scott: Kickstarter for, you know, pebble work, right?

953
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,990
Scott: They succeeded and the Kickstarter should be small fucking phone phone.

954
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,028
Scott: That's reasonably sized.

955
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:01,470
Scott: Yes.

956
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,208
Scott: Kickstart it.

957
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,688
Rym: You know what?

958
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:07,230
Rym: It'll be a millimeter thicker and it'll be an inch and a half smaller in every direction.

959
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,276
Scott: It'll be the same as an iPhone four, but only it'll be modernly fast.

960
00:51:11,337 --> 00:51:13,710
Scott: or the quality screen run stock Android.

961
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:14,628
Scott: The end.

962
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,110
Scott: Yeah, we will always update it with the most newest Android.

963
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:20,250
Scott: It'll be unlocked with every radio for the whole world.

964
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,769
Rym: Ask Conrad like what Snapdragon chip to put in there.

965
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,370
Scott: Let's just try to, we'll just get the newest whatever.

966
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,010
Scott: So just hire the, we'll hire away some of the best phone making people.

967
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,609
Scott: We'll just make the best phone.

968
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

969
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

970
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

971
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

972
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,620
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
