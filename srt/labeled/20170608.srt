00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,701
Rym: It's Thursday, June 8th, 2017.

2
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,222
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:12,944
Scott: That's good.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,790
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:31,587
Rym: barbecue Let's do this And I suppose to a lesser extent just grilling because I feel like a lot of people say barbecue when they mean just Literally cooking anything on a grill not the same thing, which isn't even a barbecue.

6
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:31,929
Rym: I guess.

7
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:38,280
Scott: Yeah Gonna get mad at people saying About you and they mean Teppanyaki.

8
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:38,663
Rym: Yep.

9
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:39,890
Rym: That's why I don't get mad.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,673
Rym: I usually pointed out.

11
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:41,255
Rym: then I laugh.

12
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:46,697
Rym: but the problem is I can't call it Teppanyaki because no one will know what the fuck I'm Talking about except in like.

13
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,424
Rym: well actually anywhere but the u.s.

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:48,906
Rym: It's fine.

15
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:55,614
Rym: So Remember we were in Melbourne and we just googled for what is the best Teppanyaki place in the entire city and we just ate there Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:55,978 --> 00:01:04,623
Rym: That was a lot of money Yeah, but it was more money than I had budgeted for in terms of like eating on that trip because I was not a cheap All told.

17
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:12,486
Rym: but What's crazy is that round-trip flights now cost like a fifth what we paid back then.

18
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,570
Scott: cuz no one wants to fly.

19
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:20,425
Rym: Well, but so Australia is super cheap But like going to Tokyo not any cheaper for some reason like it's way more expensive.

20
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:22,352
Rym: go to Tokyo then go to see wanna go There.

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,190
Scott: people want to go to Australia - not as much as they want to go to Tokyo.

22
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:28,110
Rym: But why is it so much cheaper?

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,473
Rym: There's so many people going to Australia Back.

24
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:33,609
Rym: when we went to that first pack saws it just aren't going now like I don't know what's going on.

25
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,197
Rym: Anyway, it's a Thursday.

26
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:37,844
Rym: It's the lounge on GeekNights here.

27
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:48,664
Rym: We can talk about whatever we want and If you're hearing this new from me right now You are so late to the party that you might as well start looking at PAX West 2018.

28
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:52,038
Scott: I guess I got some badges.

29
00:01:52,078 --> 00:02:03,698
Rym: you can have your money, so this happens every year and All of all the packs is PAX East and PAX West are Equally difficult for different reasons.

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,270
Rym: PAX West is difficult because it is the mothership packs.

31
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:21,330
Rym: People from all over the world try to get in and as best I can tell you have About two to two point five minutes between when the packs account tweets that badges are live.

32
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:25,850
Rym: It's not a lot of minutes before the last person enters that queue.

33
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:30,285
Rym: Who will then buy the last badges at least the last Saturday one?

34
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,750
Scott: I think you can still buy a Monday one.

35
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,121
Rym: There are a small hours.

36
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,090
Scott: It's been hours, and you can still buy a Monday one.

37
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,779
Rym: There is a small number of Monday badges left.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,666
Scott: a lot of people just go there even though Monday's Labor Day They're buying Friday Saturday Sunday badges, and they're not buying Monday's.

39
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:50,024
Rym: yep I mean I want all four if I'm flying somewhere.

40
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,650
Rym: I'm going to the fullness of the convention.

41
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,329
Rym: That's just kind of high local types.

42
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:58,870
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I feel like I mean I've heard you're missing that omega-thon finale.

43
00:02:58,931 --> 00:02:59,469
Scott: What's wrong with you?

44
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:01,356
Rym: Because there's only one of me.

45
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:07,639
Rym: like they try to replicate the content like there's two Q&A's so like there's more chance to see In both, but the omega-thon nothing gets replicated.

46
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:20,566
Rym: There's just round round round round tournament and The omega-thon finale is one of my favorite parts of packs, and it's been so consistently, but yeah anyway Yeah, I clicked on the link within like 30 seconds.

47
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,390
Rym: I was sitting at work.

48
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:24,086
Rym: I had the alert set up for a while.

49
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:30,887
Scott: Tyco tweeted He's like hey guys You know you can pre buy that you can buy this merch when the tickets go on sale whenever that is.

50
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,877
Scott: and I'm like yeah I was like all right.

51
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,683
Scott: We're on high alert right?

52
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:42,590
Scott: so I go into the forum like hey everyone remember We're on a high alert and then like a minute later the tweet dang click.

53
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:47,133
Rym: No, I saw his tweet and for a second I was like that's nice.

54
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:52,626
Rym: and then the lizard part of my brain said Rym you got to start from hitting fucking f5 as fast as you can.

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,468
Rym: uh But at PAX East the badges don't sell out quite as fast.

56
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:01,024
Rym: you have like Dozens of minutes before the main ones sell out.

57
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:05,189
Rym: not a lot of minutes But yeah dozens of minutes is not a long time when you think about it.

58
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:11,310
Rym: But the hotels that don't require mass transit or a cab they sell out in seconds.

59
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:16,470
Rym: They're basically sold out before the badges go on sale because you know exhibitors can buy their better.

60
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,742
Rym: We should you know if PAX ever gets bad enough.

61
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:19,325
Rym: We got money.

62
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,130
Rym: We should buy.

63
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,134
Scott: It's a million times.

64
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:22,137
Scott: you're not saying anything new.

65
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,266
Scott: the point is today was the day for PAX OS 2017 tickets.

66
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:30,575
Scott: I got four full sets of tickets the maximum allowed Ticket purchase.

67
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,201
Scott: the price went way up.

68
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:32,904
Scott: it cost like $700.

69
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:36,177
Scott: yep But I'm not using all these.

70
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:39,970
Scott: so user for friends and in case our panel doesn't get accepted.

71
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,404
Scott: So yeah holding back a set the rule.

72
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:50,553
Rym: the reality is If you're going to kind of like packs you need to have a pool of friends who are all going and you need to together Coordinate.

73
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:55,290
Rym: because of our friend group not everyone got into the queue in time to buy badges.

74
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,719
Rym: Enough of us did to get badges for all of.

75
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:07,762
Scott: so whoever needs the badges you gotta let me know Cuz I need to pay back this money's cuz I cannot And we don't want to scalp them.

76
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,488
Rym: we basically just want to sell them at cost to.

77
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:14,857
Scott: like a friend I only bought them for insurance purposes in case our panels not accepted and such like that I have.

78
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,948
Scott: no you know I want them to go to someone who's gonna go to PAX and I don't want to put in a lot of effort Trying to find someone who will buy them.

79
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,919
Scott: So it's the face value.

80
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,363
Rym: not hard to do that.

81
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:35,793
Scott: for PAX West the past one year I just sort of like met people on the street outside packs that I arranged with at the packs pass exchange Reddit whatever.

82
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:39,086
Rym: also, you know, I'll be in town because PAX dev.

83
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,097
Rym: there is some interesting though Thanks dev is actually a day earlier than usual.

84
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:45,249
Rym: So there's a gap day between dev and Wes.

85
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:54,250
Rym: So I had I would stay in town basically an extra day But something crazy happened when I clicked on the thing because I went straight hotel and Scott went badge.

86
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:59,150
Rym: The Sheraton showed up as not booked which is insane.

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,665
Rym: The Sheraton traditionally is 100% booked long before badges go on sale.

88
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,170
Rym: Like you just cannot be in that hotel.

89
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:10,370
Rym: It used to be the hotel that like everyone stayed in every year because it's the one connected to the convention center.

90
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:11,346
Rym: It's like right there.

91
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:16,765
Rym: So, uh, I see it I click on it and it totally has a room.

92
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:18,530
Rym: like there are rooms available.

93
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,801
Rym: so I like Immediately as phallic.

94
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,199
Rym: I'm like, oh shit I start typing my credit card stuff in.

95
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:37,622
Rym: I hit submit maybe 15 seconds later and I get an error saying the room you're trying to book was booked by someone else before that website Transacted bad website and then it says but click.

96
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:40,010
Rym: because it says click here to try a different hotel.

97
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:45,649
Rym: I click there and it says oh your session took too long You got to start over and then it just showed me an error that went forever.

98
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,493
Rym: Every time I went back to the site with that web browser It was stuck.

99
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,518
Rym: I used a different.

100
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:58,809
Rym: I went in incognito mode and I got back in and By that point all the hotels were booked and I found one at the last second and I got a hotel room.

101
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:09,009
Rym: The real problem was there were no rooms available at most of the hotels for the gap day between dev and West Mmm, and you can't book two rooms.

102
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:15,856
Rym: So if you're going to dev you were basically fucked unless you picked like the two hotels That had rooms on that.

103
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:19,430
Scott: one day you can go through the system book goes to the system and book again.

104
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,397
Rym: I tried that once years ago.

105
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,244
Rym: In fact, remember, you know when I tried to do it?

106
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,718
Rym: remember when we bought John St John a hotel room.

107
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,424
Rym: Yeah.

108
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:27,069
Scott: Yeah that time.

109
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,748
Rym: So when I tried to book the second one the system said you already have a PAX room.

110
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,338
Rym: Fuck you You can't get to you scalper piece of shit.

111
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:36,341
Scott: use a different.

112
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:40,960
Rym: you can't scalp a hotel room first of all Yeah, but it basically said you're only allowed to have one.

113
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,727
Scott: just you use a different name use it.

114
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:47,110
Rym: Yeah, I've used different name email letters everything.

115
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:51,884
Rym: So all I did back then is I just booked directly at the hotel.

116
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:52,486
Rym: max cuz.

117
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,370
Rym: frankly I love John But I didn't care if he stayed further away from packs.

118
00:07:57,092 --> 00:08:01,206
Scott: So but anyway each one full set of packs passes this year.

119
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,812
Scott: They're $48 per day.

120
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:11,624
Scott: Yeah $192 for a full set and then on top and there's a $10 fee.

121
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,270
Scott: that applies to the whole transaction.

122
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:20,554
Scott: So if you want to go to a day of packs to all the facts West it will cost you 192 dollars.

123
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:30,686
Rym: Yep going to change go into the single day badges was partly a ploy to Substantially raise the price of packs without saying they raised the price of packs.

124
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:31,670
Rym: That's something that happened.

125
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,167
Scott: Yeah, cuz look the price to get into packs to enjoy packs is 48 dollars.

126
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,602
Scott: You just want to experience packs as totally reasonable before it's like.

127
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,909
Scott: well weekend passes are pretty much all anyone's buying.

128
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,979
Scott: So the price to get into packs is to buy.

129
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,390
Scott: one of those is like, you know a hundred and something dollars Yeah, but so, uh, yeah, we'll see.

130
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,754
Rym: There's rumors of other packs.

131
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:55,188
Rym: is like pax East also becoming four days at some point and see we'll see if that happens.

132
00:08:55,468 --> 00:09:04,809
Rym: that adds That adds to my enforcing burden at pax East but it also means pax East could be a little more chill anyway If you don't already have a fax badge.

133
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,479
Rym: You missed it so hard.

134
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:09,167
Rym: I don't know what to say to you.

135
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,452
Scott: Hope you got $192.

136
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:20,922
Rym: yep, send it my way and be ready because magfest is gonna have the exact same problem Like any nerd con that's good is gonna have this problem.

137
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:22,005
Rym: There's no way around this.

138
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:22,306
Rym: Mm-hmm.

139
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:23,390
Rym: So you got any news?

140
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,052
Scott: I do have a news.

141
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:25,935
Scott: a chick take this out.

142
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:33,399
Scott: It's kind of weird, right and I'm still I'm you know, not being Super hyper educated in this area.

143
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,230
Scott: I got a lot of questions that no one ever answered, right?

144
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:40,185
Rym: So I'm not gonna pretend I'll pretend that I know the answers but I really don't.

145
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:40,827
Scott: we all know.

146
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,399
Scott: yeah, of course You'll pretend you know the answer.

147
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,430
Scott: That's what you do for everything.

148
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:48,650
Scott: So we all know you find fossils and all kinds of places usually in rocks, right?

149
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:55,650
Rym: But also in precious amber, which I think most of our generation learned that from Jurassic Park, right?

150
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,993
Scott: So anyway some scientists Where was this?

151
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,439
Scott: like Burma or something like that?

152
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,868
Scott: or somewhere far away Malaysia something something.

153
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:05,530
Rym: I didn't read this order.

154
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,708
Rym: I actually don't know about this news.

155
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:23,440
Scott: Yeah the location I don't remember but basically they found an almost completely intact bird and I not like a skeleton of a bird like actual bird like its head Part of its wing its feats a lot of skin Right.

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,582
Scott: That's some biz Like actual, you know, and it was in amber.

157
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,991
Scott: So oh, yeah Burma's Burmese amber I guess.

158
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,459
Scott: does Burmese amber mean it's in Burma?

159
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,970
Scott: or does Burmese amber that the type of amber that could be in places that aren't?

160
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:40,502
Rym: I don't even know enough to pretend that I know the answer to that.

161
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:45,458
Scott: Anyway, the point is this shit is 99 million year old bird.

162
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:47,424
Scott: This is a bird that lived with dinosaurs.

163
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:47,805
Rym: Oh, man.

164
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:48,648
Rym: Look at the reconstruction.

165
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:52,580
Rym: It's a cute little guy Yeah, so stubby tail thing-a-ling.

166
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,790
Scott: But yeah, he's uh in this amber and they got him.

167
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,496
Scott: They can't get any DNA's from there.

168
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:05,429
Scott: Apparently they say but you can still learn a hell of a lot Because usually a fossil is a skeleton or an outline of a shape.

169
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:09,761
Scott: Right, so this is like hope pretty holy shit right here.

170
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:14,957
Scott: the questions I have is I don't really understand how amber works.

171
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,041
Rym: You know, what amber is?

172
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:19,010
Scott: Yeah, it's just like tree juice tree sap, right?

173
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,933
Scott: So here's the thing though.

174
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,401
Scott: If you got imagine a tree with some sap.

175
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:25,030
Scott: right tree sap is thick and slow.

176
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:26,949
Scott: How does a bird?

177
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,082
Scott: Get into trees?

178
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,029
Scott: have that deep?

179
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,905
Scott: I had to be like the dumbest bird and how does there had to be like a bowl full of trees?

180
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,011
Scott: have somewhere like so much Of it.

181
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:44,536
Rym: I've seen trees that have so much crazy thick like sap coming out of them Pooling around them.

182
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:47,269
Rym: I think most of the fossils in amber there are a little tiny guys.

183
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:52,130
Scott: This is a pretty tiny guy, you know, if you look at that, there's a coin next to the picture of the amber.

184
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,029
Scott: it's pretty small, but it's like.

185
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,290
Scott: How do you mean insects getting stuck in the amber makes sense, right?

186
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,287
Scott: Maybe a leaf getting stuck in the amber makes sense, but even a small bird getting stuck in there to this extent.

187
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,846
Scott: It's like It's like if I got caught in a race by a sloth, it's like it makes.

188
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:10,770
Scott: it doesn't make any sense.

189
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:22,297
Rym: I think a lot of them I would guess are Animals that died and fell somewhere where they got stuck in amber, but the amber doesn't flow like a river Does just real slow.

190
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:26,250
Scott: the bird would decompose a lot by the time the amber covered that much of it.

191
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:28,664
Scott: I guess this is just the random chance, right?

192
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:29,650
Scott: That's why we haven't found these.

193
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:41,230
Rym: I was googling to try to like find like a succinct explanation of this and Mostly what I'm finding are web pages that have bad backgrounds and bad fonts, which is always a bad sign when you're googling for something.

194
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,730
Rym: Yep, so I don't actually know and I can't answer it without pausing the show long enough to read one of these things.

195
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,930
Scott: Yeah, but like I just you know Like I know that things were trapped in amber and once you're trapped in there it gets hard and is preserved for a long time.

196
00:12:55,031 --> 00:13:03,505
Rym: I get the impression that anything I think anything large that gets trapped in amber is a fluke and it's just.

197
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:10,290
Rym: there's so much history that like There's some place where an entire bird's nest fell in some amber and I got a bunch of birds.

198
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,250
Scott: It's like I couldn't possibly get stuck in an amber.

199
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,376
Scott: I just had to wash my hands a little bit.

200
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:14,643
Rym: I could get you stuck in some amber.

201
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,030
Scott: How much amber are you gonna get?

202
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,389
Rym: What if I tie you up and just like tie you to a really sappy tree and leave you there?

203
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:20,875
Scott: How long it would take.

204
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:29,383
Scott: I would probably just give you even if someone rescued me weeks later if I wasn't dead from Dying of dehydration or lack of food or exposure or something.

205
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,429
Scott: I could probably just peel myself off.

206
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,210
Rym: I don't know depends on a male Like.

207
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,415
Rym: I'd have to tie you up pretty tight.

208
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,563
Rym: just let the amber wash over.

209
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,672
Rym: let the sap wash over you Uh-huh.

210
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:42,790
Rym: I uh, yeah, all these websites have bad fonts?

211
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,031
Rym: I can't.

212
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:45,783
Rym: I don't actually know the answer to that question, but I like that little birdie.

213
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,250
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting stuff.

214
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,956
Rym: There's some really actually interesting Political news from over in the UK.

215
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:53,323
Rym: So, you know their elections happening.

216
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,910
Scott: Well, they have elections whenever they want.

217
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,117
Scott: They don't have an election day.

218
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:06,443
Rym: They just dissolve their government when they give up Normal times have elections and there's ways to call for elections I'm not gonna explain like the UK parliamentary process because it's but it is.

219
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:07,727
Scott: this is a called for.

220
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,398
Scott: this is a Government.

221
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,546
Rym: the way I'll put it is the.

222
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:20,248
Rym: a Conservative government came in partly on the heels of brexit and brexit likely happened for a lot of the same reasons that Trump happened in the US.

223
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:31,826
Rym: So this happened and the conservative government that had a very like narrow Stranglehold on power called for early elections thinking that they could ride this wave and totally take over the government.

224
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:36,282
Rym: and what appears to have Happened is that I thought it's not counted yet.

225
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:37,870
Rym: So exit polls are done.

226
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:47,621
Rym: Exit polls are usually real accurate usually so the exit polls Heavily imply that at best.

227
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,610
Rym: It's a hung parliament meaning.

228
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,490
Scott: Doesn't that mean they need to have another election?

229
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,173
Rym: I know it means that no party has a complete majority and anyone who wants to do anything has to do it in coalition with At least one other party.

230
00:14:59,193 --> 00:14:59,815
Rym: Mm-hmm.

231
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:22,070
Rym: This has some if this is a the read on this is that America is fucked up so much shit since Trump got elected that The forces that were similar to the things that caused Trump to get elected in the US in places like the UK Kind of slammed on the brakes and there's been sort of a regression to the mean or a reaction back toward the left.

232
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,900
Rym: So it's almost like the.

233
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:28,390
Rym: the bad politics in the US Scared all the dumb people who are you know?

234
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:34,919
Rym: So-called undecided voters and people who call themselves centrists Into not voting for crazy people.

235
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,010
Scott: That's how that's how democracies have worked for decades, right?

236
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,517
Scott: You see whoever's in power.

237
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,010
Scott: you hate them because you see all them fucking up shit.

238
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,739
Scott: So you're mad at them and you vote for the other guy.

239
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,769
Scott: the other guy gets in power, but they're shitty, too.

240
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:46,759
Scott: So you're mad at them.

241
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,729
Scott: so you vote for the other guy.

242
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,218
Scott: The other guy is just the first guy.

243
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:52,330
Scott: you forgot that you hated them because it was so long ago They fucked it up.

244
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:02,153
Rym: So you vote for the other guy and we've been doing that for like longer than I've been alive But then we broke and voted for like So bad that you don't even know what to do like.

245
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,200
Rym: I mean like our president literally didn't know.

246
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,917
Rym: we have an airbase in Qatar and I mean Do you know where every base is?

247
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,122
Scott: Hmm?

248
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,809
Scott: Do you know where every single base is?

249
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,290
Rym: No, but yeah, everyone knows there's a base in Qatar because it's in the news all the time cuz shit happens.

250
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:23,745
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I know we have base in Germany in Korea more than one there in Japan.

251
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:24,788
Rym: Yeah, that's true.

252
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,670
Rym: Okay But it's all the exit polls.

253
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:38,321
Rym: This is actually pretty big news in that it has potential Substantial ramifications for whether or not brexit goes forward.

254
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,545
Rym: We'll see how this all goes.

255
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:49,744
Rym: The problem is Now it's a hurry up and wait situation because until they actually count the vote which probably won't be done tonight All we have is these I can't they be done tonight with voting.

256
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:50,689
Scott: We don't take that long to.

257
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,373
Rym: yeah We do.

258
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,789
Rym: we don't actually finish counting the vote for a long time.

259
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:59,591
Scott: Yeah, but we know what the deal is like, yeah, well partly on enough of them Every.

260
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,800
Scott: how are they voting in the UK with like signal flags?

261
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,888
Rym: I Don't actually know what they do.

262
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,890
Rym: I'm like what kinds of voting machines they use or whatever.

263
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:23,742
Rym: But this is sort of developing news and even if you don't know anything or care about politics You probably see what's going on in the UK because it'll depress you a lot less than what's going on in the US and a hung parliament might actually be pretty funny and interesting going forward.

264
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,010
Rym: because imagine if that happened in the u.s.

265
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:38,210
Rym: If instead of just like a swing of either The normal party gets it or the crazy party gets it It would be if you're too close to a 50/50 split then nobody gets anything and the government's just paralyzed for another four years.

266
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:43,457
Scott: Well, they can just have another election whenever they want and I Rules about what they can't.

267
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,070
Rym: she can't just like immediately call the election right after this one.

268
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:56,408
Rym: Also, it's still technically a monarchy the Queen can just shut the whole shit down Yeah, but not really because the monarch the monarchy ceded a lot of powers to the parliamentary system.

269
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:57,089
Scott: take him back.

270
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:59,380
Scott: Good to be the king queen.

271
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,286
Scott: Yeah king queen Whatever you are.

272
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:07,930
Rym: Well, I mean it could be weird like, you know, you know Francis system works.

273
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:26,269
Rym: There's no king of France anymore, but there is both a president and a prime minister, but the president is just like a Person who doesn't do anything Symbolic figure a lot like a US president and the Prime Minister is more like the president of the Congress.

274
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,966
Rym: Anyway, this stuff's all fascinating the Parliament.

275
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:30,509
Scott: They don't have a kind.

276
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:34,971
Rym: Yeah, well I said the Congress so I'm trying to analogize it back to what the u.s Is like.

277
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:39,830
Rym: imagine if we had a president president for like war and like as one narrow area of stuff.

278
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:45,210
Rym: Then we had another president who like was basically the head of Congress and like represented Congress.

279
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,954
Rym: We kind of have that with the majority leaders But I don't know.

280
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:54,410
Rym: our government is like the weirdest most complicated version of democracy in the world.

281
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,359
Scott: It's because ours isn't old.

282
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,866
Scott: see as though the u.s.

283
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:58,630
Scott: Is much younger.

284
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:04,101
Rym: Ours is the oldest because their constitutional monarchies are.

285
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:12,559
Scott: we're in many ways pretty democratic long before the u.s Pretty but they weren't like having everyone vote The way we were.

286
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,430
Rym: I'd see what about Athens.

287
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,656
Scott: Athens wasn't around.

288
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:17,802
Scott: it doesn't exist anymore.

289
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:21,454
Scott: I'm talking about the oldest one the oldest Democracy that still exists.

290
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:22,818
Rym: Okay.

291
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:28,554
Scott: Okay that I mean, I guess Greece has voting now, but It's not the same.

292
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:28,955
Scott: It's not.

293
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,724
Scott: it wasn't a clean line from Athens to the current Greece.

294
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,189
Scott: It's not the same.

295
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:34,790
Scott: Anyway.

296
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,175
Rym: So speaking of hotels.

297
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:48,421
Rym: this news been making the rounds everywhere and I've been I've been looking thinking about it a lot in the sense That the hotel industry is having a lot of problems partly because People like us Airbnb.

298
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,350
Rym: Yeah, Airbnb is one problem.

299
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:55,530
Rym: The other problem is that people like us much like with flights don't really give a shit where we stay.

300
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:57,939
Rym: We just want to be close to the thing we're doing.

301
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,341
Rym: Yes.

302
00:19:58,562 --> 00:19:59,405
Rym: We're not flexible.

303
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:03,444
Rym: Like we're going this weekend We literally we are not willing to show up a day earlier.

304
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:07,260
Rym: We're not willing to show up a day Later, we have a very specific window.

305
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,184
Rym: We want to go anywhere.

306
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:14,565
Rym: Mm-hmm Our only real concern is being as close to the thing we're doing as possible and not having bedbugs.

307
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:15,146
Scott: Mm-hmm.

308
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:23,229
Rym: So Hotels really can't compete with each other with our prices generation other than on price.

309
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:24,878
Rym: Remove proximity.

310
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,010
Scott: stop offering all the services that no one uses.

311
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:32,953
Rym: Yeah, the problem is those services are probably the only way they actually make money and if they don't offer those services They probably just raise their.

312
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:38,930
Scott: for example, do you have a room service that delivers like $5 eggs to people, right?

313
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,181
Scott: No one's stupid enough to buy five people are.

314
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,330
Scott: well, listen, you're mad at packs.

315
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,097
Rym: You know how many of those trays I see sitting out of people's rooms rich people I don't think.

316
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,869
Rym: I think it's packs people who are just dumb.

317
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:56,752
Scott: I know the point is if you get if you're selling five dollar eggs and a lot of people buy them you're raking in big Cash.

318
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,530
Scott: and if you're selling final eggs and no one's buying them, you should just close your goddamn kitchen.

319
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:05,809
Scott: Yeah Well the funniest thing is still sell the $5 eggs and just buy the eggs from like the nearby deli.

320
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,010
Rym: What hurt the most was smartphones been tablets because suddenly people had internet that just worked on their phones.

321
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,089
Rym: They didn't need to pay like 20 bucks a day for internet from the hotel.

322
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:18,510
Scott: Give me free internet and I might choose your hotel over the one that does not free.

323
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,190
Scott: I say that if I if I have a choice, I've literally never checked.

324
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,757
Scott: Well, because I usually don't have a choice.

325
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,110
Rym: and that first room wherever I can Yeah, that first packs went to you back in a way where stuff didn't sell out.

326
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:38,448
Rym: The red line was like hey if you stay here and you're going to packs for your Wi-Fi They gave us like a little like tax thing and everything when we checked in back in.

327
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:41,229
Rym: Oh eight Which was like almost a decade ago.

328
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:42,194
Scott: I also.

329
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:48,178
Scott: if I'm choosing a hotel to host an event then I'm gonna be very choosy Yep, but what's hurting hotels?

330
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:49,080
Rym: what hurt hotels then?

331
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,050
Rym: the biggest thing was that businessmen didn't pay for porn anymore.

332
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:53,989
Rym: No on the TV networks.

333
00:21:54,433 --> 00:22:05,730
Rym: what's killing them now is that pretty much everyone just books hotels either by going to like Google Maps or like a kayak or something and Just typing in their dates and looking at a list of hotels and pick up what everyone's cheap.

334
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,036
Scott: Same thing we do with airline.

335
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:14,484
Rym: Yep, except those services for hotels Take a way bigger cut than the airline ones do.

336
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,230
Scott: Oh, they're taking a cut from the hotel.

337
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,830
Rym: Yeah, they take up to 30% according to this article.

338
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,027
Scott: Listen if you want to the hotel should do what the airline does make the room smaller have more rooms.

339
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:29,350
Rym: So Actually, I would say I would stay in like a capsule hotel if it existed.

340
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,273
Rym: Why not convention?

341
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:32,280
Rym: because I'm pretty much only.

342
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,250
Scott: I just need a place to put my stuff a place to sleep and a shower.

343
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:41,195
Scott: I don't need any of the other stuff and I don't use the TV Our outlets to charge my business.

344
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:48,187
Rym: Antonio uses giant-ass living rooms in the Contessa to play our RPGs because it's quiet Yeah, but you can just if it's a capsule hotel.

345
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:55,653
Scott: you have you know You know this shared as a shower room and there's a room of you know, tables and you know Common area.

346
00:22:55,673 --> 00:23:01,614
Rym: you imagine how lit a capsule hotel would be at a place like PAX everyone in their little capsule with their switch At night.

347
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:02,139
Scott: Mm-hmm.

348
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,309
Rym: Yeah good times.

349
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:06,683
Rym: but so this is an article kind of talking about that.

350
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:11,685
Rym: because uh, I think the hotel industry is gonna go through like a major.

351
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,819
Rym: they're fucked Situation in the next few years.

352
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,750
Scott: buy some cheap hotel and capsule it.

353
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:18,636
Rym: Yeah, the problem actually the.

354
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:26,188
Rym: so I looked into that like a decade ago and Hotel into why there weren't capsule hotels like in the u.s.

355
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,590
Rym: Laws.

356
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,915
Rym: Yeah, the fire code in the u.s.

357
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:35,953
Rym: Compared to the fire Japan's fire code as far as I can tell is actually way Way lax.

358
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:40,350
Rym: I mean you can do some shit that would not fly in the u.s.

359
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,602
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is, you know, Japan unlike the u.s.

360
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:43,326
Scott: Is way old.

361
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:55,189
Rym: as you're talking I feel like Japan trusted citizens to exit a building in an orderly fashion in a way that you could People use objects like the kotatsu in every home.

362
00:23:55,229 --> 00:24:05,290
Rym: Scott I was on a bus the last time I was there with Emily and we're going up into the mountains like go to the fancy Restaurant and the bus had its aisle down the middle and had two seats on each side like Rose, right?

363
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:18,644
Rym: Mm-hmm in the aisle You could pull a thing out of any given seat pull it across entirely blocking the aisle and making another seat So you could turn the entire aisle into you into another set of seats.

364
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:27,196
Rym: So like another 20 seats or another 40 seats Mm-hmm, that is that would be so illegal that you would go to jail in the u.s Yeah Sure.

365
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:28,845
Rym: Yeah, I was just stare.

366
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,799
Rym: the whole bus ride I was staring at it like marveling and I like.

367
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,685
Rym: I use my thin internet connection to like Read articles and try to figure out like has that ever caused a disaster?

368
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:39,869
Rym: Like is that killed people?

369
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:54,550
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but I mean think about if you've got buildings that are so old and wooden that they're not gonna pass any fire code on Earth but you're not gonna destroy them because historic reasons and also you're not gonna stop using them because they're amazing and whatever.

370
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,529
Scott: Why even bother having a fire code for your new bill?

371
00:24:59,254 --> 00:24:59,895
Scott: You know, it's like.

372
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:05,730
Scott: well our whole place is already flammable and we're not changing it because we got more important reasons to not change it.

373
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:12,980
Rym: So but here's what's real different about the hotel situation compared to Airlines and all the other industries is happening to a lot of castles burnt down.

374
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,816
Rym: Airlines have some regulation.

375
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:19,146
Rym: It's weak weak sauce regulation, but it is regulation where they can't.

376
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,670
Rym: if they just bump you from a flight.

377
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,566
Rym: There's some stuff they have to do to like make it up to you.

378
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:28,710
Rym: to a degree Hotels can just bump you and give you the finger and you're just completely fucked.

379
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:43,510
Rym: so what a lot of hotels apparently are starting to do is They'll take the bookings from these like these travel sites But if they fill up, they'll only bump the people who booked from the travel sites instead of the people who booked directly.

380
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:49,350
Rym: Mmm, and that's happened to people I know a few times and I think it's gonna be a huge problem going forward.

381
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,798
Rym: I bring this up illegal to sell something.

382
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:58,489
Scott: You don't have yeah, I think period and no matter what business you're in I shouldn't be allowed to sell something if you don't have it.

383
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,843
Scott: That includes kick-starting some product you haven't manufactured.

384
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:04,305
Rym: I don't have.

385
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:08,730
Rym: I just have to clear like I have to settle But I can totally put a seller and even if I don't own the stock

386
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:12,389
Scott: You should you should have to buy it first and then sell it the tie the timing should be

387
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,921
Rym: Chipped around well here with airlines and hotels specifically.

388
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,050
Rym: I think there'd be a very there should be a very specific regulation.

389
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:32,310
Rym: you can never bump anyone who does not volunteer and You just have to keep raising whatever Accommodation you're gonna offer until someone is willing to take the offer.

390
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:41,128
Rym: If you have to give someone 50 grand before they say yeah, I'll go stay at another hotel that sucks That totally sucks for you.

391
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:49,927
Scott: That's effectively the same as just preventing people because if that was the penalty if that was the rule People just wouldn't sell things they didn't have and thus the good.

392
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:50,530
Scott: back to my room.

393
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:58,630
Rym: I feel like airlines would because there are efficiencies to be had because a lot of I am always shocked whenever I fly and How many people miss their flights?

394
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:12,459
Rym: Like every time I'm at the airport There's always like constant repeated calls for people who have checked in who may in fact be at the airport and yet somehow Are not at their gate and are not about to take off on the flight.

395
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:16,050
Rym: I do not understand to this day how that happens.

396
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,055
Rym: Who these people are like what?

397
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,639
Rym: what happens in your life?

398
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,230
Rym: that you're at the airport and you just like forget to go to your gate?

399
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:29,630
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

400
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:36,270
Rym: So this came up on the Tuesday show when I when we were kids both of us watched of an American show.

401
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,820
Rym: It's like a big part of like 80s kid Americana.

402
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:48,630
Rym: It was a show in America called unsolved mysteries With Robert Stack and I watched this throughout basically my entire childhood up until about high school.

403
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,026
Scott: I only watched it like a few times when it was on and nothing else was on.

404
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,849
Rym: see the thing is, you know I watched it a lot.

405
00:27:54,392 --> 00:28:00,030
Rym: It always happened because we went to our grandparents house like what our dad's definitely watch it at grandparents house at least a few times.

406
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,375
Rym: It was always a grandma's house.

407
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,624
Scott: That was definitely a show that grandparents wanted to watch

408
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:12,192
Rym: because they were really into it and As a result, they'd always watch it and it was always on around like seven I want to say which is when we were there like after dinners We'd how

409
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,710
Scott: much of old people now believing nonsense on the internet is due to nonsense on TV.

410
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,970
Rym: Because of unsolved mysteries I was a hundred percent sure that aliens literally existed.

411
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:26,030
Scott: I believed in aliens until like high school times because of all these stupid things on TV.

412
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,524
Rym: Yeah, I was 100% convinced that certain kinds of ghosts existed.

413
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,747
Rym: I was also convinced.

414
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:32,450
Scott: I didn't believe in good.

415
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:41,864
Rym: I was also convinced that a lot of the murderers that were featured on this show Totally were in the car next to us on the way home from grandma's and I need dad.

416
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:46,822
Rym: No, I didn't believe that I was watching this when I was pretty young to be fair.

417
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:47,947
Rym: I mean the show started.

418
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:48,128
Rym: what in

419
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:50,500
Rym: 86? 85?

420
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,950
Scott: Oh alright The other reason I believe in aliens is not just based on TV, right?

421
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:14,729
Scott: TV wasn't enough to convince me of anything on its own but because like I would look outside And see like, you know, the planes flying or whatever and I you know I'd be like, oh that's a plane cuz you'd see like, you know a white light and then the red light in the back Right, but then occasionally you'd see some lights flying around at night that weren't the same?

422
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:19,030
Rym: Scott I live next to Selfridge Air National Guard Base fighter jets and nonsense.

423
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,430
Rym: If you're doing bullshit up in the air all the time one time one time this is this isn't true, right?

424
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,515
Scott: But obviously not alien.

425
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:27,403
Rym: I got a similar story.

426
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:29,030
Scott: I saw what looked like a plane.

427
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:34,796
Scott: It was a white light and a red light that looked like they were attached to each other flying in the same direction Across the sky far away.

428
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:35,499
Scott: No at night.

429
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,135
Scott: I just saw two lights blinking white red You know.

430
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:39,510
Scott: one was in the front one was in the back.

431
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,870
Scott: So it looked like the red one was on the fin in the back, right?

432
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,110
Scott: And the white one was in the front something like that, right?

433
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,113
Scott: Yeah, and he kept.

434
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:48,104
Scott: it's just going across the sky halfway across the sky.

435
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:57,550
Scott: The red one starts going down Like it like it looks like it dropped like someone like it was attached to something and someone threw it off the side of the plane.

436
00:29:58,253 --> 00:29:59,629
Scott: and the red ones going down like.

437
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:08,416
Scott: And the white one's still going straight and I'm like I'm like what the fuck and that you know Things like that, you know, yep.

438
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:10,223
Scott: Yeah noises you would hear in an old house.

439
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,668
Scott: You'd be like, oh alien.

440
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,932
Rym: Yeah Yeah, similar similar situation I saw.

441
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:22,524
Rym: I've seen a bunch of weird things in the sky as a kid that at the time at least I was 100% sure it was either aliens or crazy government nonsense.

442
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,210
Scott: I didn't believe in crazy government nonsense.

443
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:32,228
Scott: Yeah, except for hiding aliens, which now I'm more convinced than ever They'd hide no aliens because the government we have now would definitely be leaking that shit.

444
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:46,460
Scott: If you think that you still think those aliens now is the last straw has been broken I feel like there's no way that the aliens are still a secret with the government the United States has unless it's some other Government that's keeping him a secret.

445
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:56,435
Rym: Chinese alien, you know if I hadn't become Ultra internet atheist and you know the modern era of the information age say I remain like ultra naive like well into my adulthood.

446
00:30:56,796 --> 00:31:06,864
Rym: what just what would have destroyed my belief in aliens and ghosts is that as Cellphone cameras got better appearances of both dropped off at a catastrophic rate.

447
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:07,606
Scott: Oh, how can this?

448
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:08,870
Scott: never an HD picture?

449
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:12,938
Scott: It's always some blurry ass VHS camera.

450
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,770
Scott: They don't got no HD DSLR to film them aliens.

451
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:24,758
Rym: But anyway, the thing about himself mysteries was that they'd like do follow-ups episodes like oh We found the killer check this shit out.

452
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:31,723
Rym: and like they had a tip number you could call and be like I saw the killer I called I thought the tip number was America's Most Wanted not.

453
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:33,389
Rym: Oh, yeah, I might be conflating the two.

454
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:38,670
Rym: Yeah, I don't like how I conflate kickboxer and bloodsport way more than I realized.

455
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,581
Scott: I think the only thing I'm our Kickstarter is the one starter.

456
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,730
Scott: He puts a glass all over his hands.

457
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,657
Rym: Yeah, I thought that was bloodsport.

458
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:46,521
Scott: But then it's.

459
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,384
Scott: it's about kicking.

460
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:49,369
Scott: kick is in the name of the movie I don't know.

461
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,362
Scott: There's not as much kicking in the fire to put glass on his feet.

462
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,490
Rym: bloodsport is when they throw the sand in the eyes.

463
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:55,614
Scott: I don't know.

464
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:56,316
Scott: I don't remember.

465
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:58,704
Rym: cuz I feel I've seen bloodsport.

466
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:00,670
Scott: I've definitely seen a kickboxer.

467
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,952
Rym: Yeah, so if you've only seen one You've seen them all.

468
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,679
Rym: a bloodsport is way better than kickboxer.

469
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:10,750
Scott: I think Just think just watch actual martial arts.

470
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,655
Scott: You know even cops.

471
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:18,793
Rym: I probably just throw to blur them all together but unsolved mysteries Robert Stack and cops is nothing like the other Two shows.

472
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:21,250
Rym: Yeah, but I still blur like anecdotes from all together.

473
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:23,810
Rym: Okay, cuz those are all the shows like we watch at grandma's house.

474
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:41,683
Rym: but here's a Wikia about unsolved mysteries, which is my thing of the day specifically because uh, They have a whole section on all the cases that were legit solved with like the follow-up story like yeah in 2016. this dude totally got arrested.

475
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:51,745
Rym: and here's all the news articles and I was randomly clicking on these over lunch at work the other day and reading some of them and A lot of them were like, yep, it turns out there wasn't an alien.

476
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:52,869
Rym: It was a hoax.

477
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,690
Rym: It turns out that that long-lost relative was a scammer.

478
00:32:57,731 --> 00:33:03,748
Rym: Here's he's in jail, but a couple of them actually were way crazier than the show.

479
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,730
Scott: actually Guess the one I remember the most that I didn't believe even at the time.

480
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,230
Scott: Yeah was there these people and they bought a bunk bed and the bunk bed was haunted.

481
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:21,544
Rym: I think I remember that we wouldn't like it like it would And the kids were getting sick and all this horrible stuff.

482
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:24,289
Rym: and then I'm gonna find it right now I'm gonna find it here.

483
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:34,816
Scott: It showed them like demolishing the bunk bed at like the great at the at the junkyard like it was getting crushed and then like Oh as soon as here it is the Talman house the bunk bed as soon as he got rid of the bunk bed That's it.

484
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:35,470
Rym: There it is right there.

485
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,141
Scott: Yeah, as soon as they got rid of the bed everything was great.

486
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:40,490
Scott: and I'm like, that's just sounds like a coincidence.

487
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,281
Scott: There's probably nothing wrong with that bed.

488
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:46,554
Rym: All right, so Results unsolved.

489
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:49,223
Rym: there's no further evidence related to this one.

490
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:50,969
Scott: It was not enough evidence to begin with.

491
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,163
Rym: So the two crazy things didn't hurt.

492
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:55,290
Scott: anyone is innocent victim.

493
00:33:55,813 --> 00:34:11,949
Rym: So one of them I remembered this one from a kid as a kid I don't remember the name now but I clicked around until I found it and it was basically this really creepy story of a dude was like Driving like he was at a gas station and someone approached his car and like asked him for help and was really weird and was Holding a screwdriver.

494
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,036
Rym: so we got unnerved and tried to get away.

495
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:20,090
Rym: and then the guy like jumped into the car and Threatened him with the screwdriver and told him he had to drive him somewhere.

496
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:20,993
Scott: so just a crazy guy.

497
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:24,908
Rym: so he like fought with the guy and like the whole thing happened.

498
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:29,284
Rym: and eventually like he ran away from the car and the guy chased him down and dragged him back to the car.

499
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:35,790
Rym: and then like as the Guy was walking around the car being crazy to get back in because he agreed to drive the crazy guy some random over.

500
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,799
Rym: no, he just drove off.

501
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,469
Rym: good job, but Uh The guy the crazy guy kept wandering around in the area because the guy lived nearby.

502
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,149
Rym: So the guy drove off and drove to the nearest police station.

503
00:34:47,571 --> 00:35:01,519
Rym: Meanwhile, the crazy guy wandered around because he knew the guy that ran away lived in the area found a house that happened to be his house snuck in and brutally murdered the guys like mom or wife and They actually caught the guy and there's like the whole.

504
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,681
Rym: like the follow-up was kind of crazy And the other one was.

505
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:07,050
Rym: there was a couple that just disappeared.

506
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:11,850
Rym: It was like this big mystery like they just one day they went out for a drive and they were never heard of never seen.

507
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,797
Rym: Again, you know what happened?

508
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,785
Scott: their car fell off like a ravine or something.

509
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:16,387
Scott: Basically.

510
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:30,148
Rym: Yeah, they drove off the road into basically like a lagoon in a farm and the car sank and It was found recently because droughts caused the lagoon to dry so much that the car was visible.

511
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:37,129
Rym: Mm-hmm And I was that say if you were as a kid Bothered by not knowing what happens to unsolved mysteries.

512
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:42,230
Rym: a Whole bunch of them are solved and you can just go to the website and read like exactly what the deal was.

513
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,630
Scott: Here's something that doesn't take 10 minutes to talk about.

514
00:35:44,790 --> 00:36:01,795
Scott: So some people decided they want to take this tree out in their yard or whatever It's like okay, and they decided to take the tree out with what appears to be like this tiny bulldozer like You know how you go to the store to buy like a drill and there's like this real drills like the whole hog and then It's like the plastic crap.

515
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:02,336
Scott: Oh drill.

516
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:02,677
Rym: Yeah.

517
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:02,878
Rym: Yeah.

518
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:04,744
Scott: This is like the plastic crap.

519
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,690
Scott: Oh, you know bulldozing equipment.

520
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,406
Scott: It's got like a little shovel cloth thing on it.

521
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:10,170
Scott: It's like a tract.

522
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:18,203
Scott: It's almost like a little John Deere size, but it's not for mowing the lawn It's for you know, like what you like a big construction.

523
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,146
Rym: It's already like.

524
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:19,929
Rym: I got this on here.

525
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,606
Rym: This looks like shaking hands with danger like what I love.

526
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:28,501
Scott: here comes the danger Like whatever the hell this little tractor guy is right.

527
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,070
Scott: they use it to try to take down a tree which a?

528
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:42,330
Scott: If you want to take down a tree just use a saw or a chainsaw or regular saw or something like that Right B. If you're gonna use a motorized vehicle to pull down a tree Don't do it this way.

529
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,530
Scott: You can just tie a rope to the tree and drive and pull the tree and that's well.

530
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:52,110
Rym: That's much safer than what this more because when you do that, you're pulling the tree directly at your car.

531
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,670
Scott: No, you do it in a certain way one of the trees in my yard was taken down by that method.

532
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:05,338
Rym: Oh, yeah, if you know the method I'm saying the kind of person who is trying to sorta Jimmy They knew it they did it so well it like it looked like.

533
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:11,830
Scott: it was like they were basically like Yokels cuz they like literally tied a rope around the tree and a rope to the back of a pickup truck and started driving.

534
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,392
Scott: But they knew exactly how to do it Like they.

535
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:24,130
Scott: you know, it looks like actually doing it looked stupid and dangerous like YouTube was about to happen But the tree didn't hit the power lines it didn't hit land on anything.

536
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,910
Scott: I'm right the tree landed exactly where they're like, it's gonna land here and that's where it landed.

537
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:30,570
Scott: You know, I'm just a guy in the street with a pickup truck on room.

538
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:32,616
Rym: So, you know there's.

539
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:33,399
Rym: you see this a lot.

540
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,150
Scott: It's when people yeah, this guy does it stupidly and hurts himself.

541
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,847
Rym: hilarious Watch when people and he doesn't die as far as I can see.

542
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:40,973
Scott: no But it's still funny.

543
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:48,160
Rym: the the people who do these kinds of things tend to have a number of tools And then they have a problem and they don't want it.

544
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:50,108
Rym: they never decide to do research.

545
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:50,710
Scott: you got a hammer.

546
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,430
Rym: Everything looks like nails and they don't even like go to the internet.

547
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,259
Scott: Like if I want to do it, I don't think they have.

548
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,509
Scott: they must have it in it because they upload it to YouTube.

549
00:37:57,991 --> 00:38:02,248
Rym: But like they have internet my like the grout in one of our showers like moldy's.

550
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:04,439
Rym: I was good They're the caulking not the grout the caulking.

551
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:12,648
Rym: I was like, oh, maybe I'll just recall kid No and I imagined to myself if I was dumb like if I just tried to do it with no research how I would do it.

552
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,214
Rym: and Then I went and typed.

553
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,324
Rym: How do you recall a bathtub into YouTube?

554
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:18,970
Rym: and it was super easy.

555
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,370
Rym: And I watched a tutorial and the tutorial gave very very specific advice on exactly how to do it.

556
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:29,290
Rym: It's actually like really easy But the technique they tell you is not what you would do if you just tried to figure it out on your own.

557
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,850
Scott: I'd probably just take the tube of cock put it in the cock squeezy thing and just yep squirt it in there.

558
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,856
Rym: No, you got to take the old cock out first.

559
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:37,000
Rym: Mm-hmm.

560
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,710
Rym: If you just put the top all you're doing is putting Something for mold to grow on over a bunch of mold, right?

561
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,130
Scott: Well, I think is I would only be using it not in the to replace moldy cock.

562
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:52,270
Scott: But I have some areas where there's no cock at all already and I would just be using it to fill in those areas.

563
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,755
Scott: So apparently you don't.

564
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:57,710
Rym: you don't like put a bead and then like pull the cock gun across like squeezing the trigger.

565
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:04,629
Rym: Yeah, push it forward Like I watch a video that shows the technique and there's all these specific reasons why?

566
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:09,790
Rym: So when I was in middle school, I had shop class and shop class at least back then.

567
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,070
Rym: I don't know how it is today if they even have shop class anymore.

568
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,958
Rym: It was pretty legit and dangerous.

569
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:15,484
Rym: Like it was just a. it was a machine shop.

570
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:16,950
Scott: We had saws it was wood shop.

571
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:18,370
Rym: We had like plastics labs.

572
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:29,110
Rym: Like I had vacuum forming machines and all sorts of dangerous nonsense in there, but a kid in my middle school He did the belt sander is being used by someone else and he didn't want to wait.

573
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:39,819
Rym: So he tried to sand a piece of wood by turning on the band saw and Russian the wood against the side of the blade genius.

574
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:46,497
Rym: and Yeah, he cut off at least one finger And we had this whole lesson after that on.

575
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:57,490
Rym: don't use a tool for a thing that it is not explicitly designed to do Unless you either really really really are a professional and know what you're doing or you're really really hate having ten fingers.

576
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:03,369
Scott: Oh, you really really really want to get a lot of YouTube views Regardless of the danger.

577
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:05,975
Scott: Shake hands with danger.

578

Rym: So, uh, yeah barbecue gonna gonna give a full.

00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:15,129
Rym: I guess them at a moment.

582
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:16,849
Rym: first The booklet book is Frank Herbert's dude.

583
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:18,008
Rym: I'll read it at some point.

584
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:20,641
Rym: My YouTube channel has a whole bunch of stuff on it.

585
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:22,790
Rym: Scott's YouTube channel has a whole bunch of stuff on it.

586
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,120
Rym: You should subscribe to both because we're both escalating our YouTube content and we're gonna do more and more and more as time goes on.

587
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,378
Rym: Uh, yeah follow us on all our biz.

588
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,834
Rym: and Other than that back to the show.

589
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:38,572
Rym: so You got any meta?

590
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:42,547
Rym: No We are not experts on barbecue.

591
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,673
Rym: No, I'm not even gonna pretend.

592
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,178
Scott: I'm an expert on eating bar.

593
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:59,290
Rym: without looking at Put it in to it and I taste the deliciousness, but if you hand me some barbecue I'm not gonna be able to tell you if it's Kansas style Versus like North Carolina style or I guess Memphis style.

594
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,192
Rym: Like I do not know.

595
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:12,069
Rym: all I know is that I like barbecue and we're gonna be real wrong about a lot of the details of barbecue and We know well, you don't care.

596
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,980
Scott: Well, listen when I was young, right?

597
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,680
Scott: I thought there was a device called the barbecue which is basically a metal bucket with legs that you would put charcoal in.

598
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:20,919
Rym: Yeah, you mean a grill?

599
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,027
Scott: Yeah, well you would like.

600
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:27,180
Scott: we called it a barbecue even though we used it for grilling and not for barbecuing.

601
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:30,690
Scott: But as you know, I can I didn't know right.

602
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,137
Scott: so it's like we had a device.

603
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:34,160
Scott: we called it a barbecue.

604
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,771
Scott: We had a barbecue, right?

605
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:39,020
Scott: We would put things on there.

606
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,711
Scott: So I figured out that's we barbecued those things.

607
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,918
Scott: but no we did not barbecue those things right.

608
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:57,121
Scott: putting you know having hot coals even if you put them in a barbecue and Then putting meats on there or other things In the fiery area like hot dog hamburger, etc.

609
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,766
Scott: That is not barbecuing.

610
00:41:58,806 --> 00:41:59,508
Scott: That is grilling.

611
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:00,190
Scott: Yep, right?

612
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,158
Scott: Barbecuing actual barbecuing.

613
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:05,808
Scott: and it's even worse because you have things like shrimp on the barbie.

614
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,956
Scott: That's not Grilling right, of course.

615
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:11,348
Rym: I mean in the Midwest like the word barbecue just means grill to 99% of people.

616
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:13,265
Scott: That's what you know.

617
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:25,150
Scott: But actual barbecue the genre of food Is When you take things and you put them not in a fire but sort of near a fire.

618
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:32,190
Scott: You know usually in a very smoky could be sealed container where the fire is quite far from the foods.

619
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:39,790
Scott: But yet it still gets real hot in there, you know relatively speaking Yeah, but not that hot not as hot as near as directly in a fire.

620
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,849
Scott: But still you ain't putting your hand in there because your hand will cook right hundreds of degrees.

621
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:59,748
Scott: And That shit the meats you put in there that are far away from the fire and being hit by smoke and such they cook mad slow Mad slow like it takes overnight or even a day or just a long-ass time to cook, right?

622
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:03,630
Scott: No, no No, why would you start this shit like an hour before dinner, right?

623
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,699
Rym: Why would you cook your meat so slow?

624
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:07,809
Scott: when you cook the meat so slow like that?

625
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:15,817
Scott: somehow due to the magic of Science right the deliciousness factor multiplies by like a thousand.

626
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:22,210
Scott: right the meat is such that it is very moist and Delicious and all the smoky flavors come in there.

627
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:32,079
Rym: well More importantly it's a meat that if you cooked it another way would be pretty crappy meat and it takes all that hard Grizzle nonsense and turns it into wonderful delicious meat.

628
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,305
Scott: that meat just like slides off the bone.

629
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,090
Scott: Like it's not even attached anymore.

630
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:39,119
Rym: God I just wanting some barbecue like real bad.

631
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,805
Scott: We're gonna eat barbecue all weekend.

632
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:41,286
Rym: Oh, yeah.

633
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:42,530
Rym: It's the barbecue party in New York.

634
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:46,566
Rym: so yeah, I didn't you know, I'll read the work of eating right now.

635
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:54,510
Rym: barbecue or Barbecue informally barbecue or Barbie is both a cooking method and an apparatus.

636
00:43:54,891 --> 00:44:00,110
Rym: Barbecuing is done slowly over low indirect heat and food is flavored by the smoking process.

637
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,818
Rym: Well, gill grilling a related process is generally done quickly over a moderate to high direct heat.

638
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:07,059
Rym: that hardly produces smoke.

639
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:07,420
Rym: Mm-hmm.

640
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:13,450
Scott: so Barbecue also comes with a lot of associated foods, you know cornbread.

641
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,630
Rym: Corn bread is literally one of my favorite things on earth.

642
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:24,616
Rym: Remember at RIT one of them one of my staple foods was that 99 cent that cornbread was garbage But it was better than nothing.

643
00:44:24,656 --> 00:44:24,777
Rym: It was.

644
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:26,946
Scott: no I was worse than nothing is better than nothing.

645
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:27,348
Rym: you ate it.

646
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,930
Rym: You ate it when I made it barely.

647
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:33,716
Scott: You know thing is.

648
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:41,607
Rym: the cornbread I like the most is the cornbread that's like almost Cornbread pudding like it got like big corns just in it.

649
00:44:41,627 --> 00:44:44,974
Scott: Yeah bean Right big bean.

650
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:45,837
Rym: Yeah big beans.

651
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:49,730
Scott: Well, I was about this big beans at the barbecue in New York City from this guy.

652
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:55,050
Scott: I think he's from Illinois somewhere but like that got those beans might be my favorite food.

653
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,437
Scott: Oh, I'm saying cornbread.

654
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:58,990
Rym: right beans and cornbread, right?

655
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,370
Scott: You know, but you know, it's like the barbecue is the actual meats, right?

656
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:36,605
Rym: Cuz you know I was recently in Michigan so and I actually had barbecue with my family in like in Northville, which I haven't done since I was a little kid and No being older and Adult and having experienced the world and had a lot of different barbecue around and actually knowing on some level the difference barbecue and grilling I now know that Some of my relatives when they said barbecue chicken, they meant like literally Slow smoking chicken with barbecue sauce for a long time Because I remember it.

657
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:41,300
Scott: Yeah, when we said barbecue chicken, it meant grilled chicken wings with barbecue sauce on them.

658
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:49,986
Rym: Yep, so when I was out sauce and something does not make it when I was out there this branch of the family Their barbecue chicken was grilled chicken.

659
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:50,508
Scott: It was good.

660
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:55,645
Rym: Like it was a very nostalgic meal, but it was not technically barbecue chicken It was grilled chicken.

661
00:45:56,168 --> 00:45:56,309
Rym: Now.

662
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:57,093
Rym: I know the difference.

663
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,239
Rym: Yep to a degree.

664
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:10,904
Rym: but I'm thinking about barbecue a lot lately partly because when I bike to work and what I think the popularity of barbecue in at least this Geography has increased substantially Over the years.

665
00:46:11,044 --> 00:46:16,766
Rym: two different people when I mentioned barbecue earlier today on social media We're like, oh you thought they'd like.

666
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:20,357
Rym: they mentioned like this specific like Brooklyn barbecue and like like.

667
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:28,065
Rym: there's a certain Derision for the like neo barbecue in New York City, okay So I mean like to extent.

668
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,739
Scott: I understand right that like we grew up in New York's like pizza bagel.

669
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,565
Rym: I didn't grow up in New York.

670
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:33,755
Rym: Don't even don't even talk to me.

671
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:35,195
Scott: Well good Fuck you.

672
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:39,368
Scott: then Pizza bagels these sorts of things, right?

673
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:40,492
Scott: It's like there's a right way.

674
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:43,160
Scott: in a wrong way, you know some Chicago style is garbage.

675
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,454
Rym: Well, you know what like I grew up in Michigan.

676
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:50,336
Rym: So Breakfast sausage that means something specific if there ain't fennel in it any breakfast sausage.

677
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:51,540
Rym: It's just some nonsense, right?

678
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:53,632
Scott: But you know you go somewhere else.

679
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:54,880
Scott: They don't have pizza and bagel.

680
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,166
Scott: You're like what the fuck is this garbage?

681
00:46:56,186 --> 00:47:03,619
Scott: and if someone tries to have pizza and bagel there and it's obviously no good Yeah, right, but with barbecue, it doesn't seem to me.

682
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:15,360
Scott: You know, I have been around and eaten many barbecue in many places Right, including ones that people who are you know, very strict and and you know believe, you know certain things about barbecue, right?

683
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,209
Scott: including those places.

684
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:30,560
Scott: and Thing is I do recognize that there are different styles of barbecue and I could see if you had grown up with a particular style That you then might you know have a dislike for the other styles.

685
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:33,976
Rym: You grew up eating real bagels and he goes what would you consider real bagels?

686
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:34,720
Rym: you go somewhere else.

687
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,980
Scott: But but this is the difference here, right?

688
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:39,271
Rym: it's not the thing you grew up with.

689
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:48,220
Scott: a real bagel is Delicious and a non-boiled bagel a steamed bagel is disgusting is inedible disgusting garbage.

690
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,963
Rym: It's not an edible.

691
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:51,333
Rym: It's just white bread in the shape of a bagel.

692
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:52,719
Scott: Yeah, it's not right.

693
00:47:53,703 --> 00:48:05,328
Scott: But you know if I have some barbecue that is like I don't know which plate with you know Which style is which but like I might have some rib that is like this has all the sweet sauce going on And I might have another rib.

694
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:07,520
Scott: That's more like the dry kind, right?

695
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:15,140
Scott: Yeah, it's like they are both delicious as long as they're actually barbecued properly and you know The meat is so tender

696
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,509
Rym: Where you grew up though because like

697
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,559
Scott: both of those are great, you know

698
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:24,720
Rym: Midwest so Chicago style pizza and New York style all the different styles of pizza.

699
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:33,340
Rym: They all existed around me and I didn't have any like one true pizza Fallacy built into my blood and my genes or my family.

700
00:48:33,962 --> 00:48:45,020
Rym: So I like all kinds of pizza and I think I'm lucky that I grew up in a place where barbecue was not such a like Religion so that like you I can just enjoy all kinds of barbecue.

701
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,475
Scott: There's no one style that I think is just better than others like, you know, they're all just different.

702
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:57,716
Scott: I like most of them But there is definitely, you know quality highs and lows that I can recognize.

703
00:48:58,198 --> 00:49:03,577
Scott: right, you know Sometimes you get a big bean and it tastes too much like bean and not enough like barbecue, right?

704
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:07,220
Scott: It's too close to a boiled bean.

705
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,086
Rym: I like how I judge burger joints by.

706
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:16,357
Scott: sometimes you get a cornbread and the cornbread is all dry and crumbly and not moist and Buttery and hasn't have big chunks of corn in it, right like a good.

707
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:16,800
Scott: right though.

708
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,720
Scott: Sometimes you get a rib and the meat is like all kind of tough to get off of there.

709
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:23,840
Rym: Well, that's that's insane.

710
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,860
Rym: If the meat is tough that barbecue fucked up because the whole point of barbecue is to untuff in the meat, right?

711
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,905
Scott: But sometimes you get like, you know or something, you know, there's tons and tons of you know factors that can separate You know good barbecue from bad.

712
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:40,115
Scott: sometimes, you know the the sauce they make it's like, okay.

713
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:41,500
Scott: I like the sweet sauce style.

714
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,848
Scott: That's a fine style, right?

715
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,780
Scott: But sometimes they put too much sauce.

716
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,639
Scott: It's just like it's buried in sauce and it's like you're not even tasting meats.

717
00:49:48,023 --> 00:49:49,780
Scott: Even if the meats are good, they're hiding under there.

718
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:51,880
Scott: You can't taste them because the sauce just well.

719
00:49:51,900 --> 00:50:00,397
Rym: The worst is when someone pours a bunch of barbecue sauce like cold like a condiment over What was all what was previously perfectly good barbecue.

720
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:04,572
Scott: Yep Yeah barbecue sauce is the thing that you put on before the cooking.

721
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:05,235
Scott: I don't like it.

722
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:09,109
Scott: when you put barbecue sauce on After the cooking it depends on what I'm doing.

723
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,655
Scott: It's like it's freaking ketchup or something.

724
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:11,860
Rym: It's like a pulled pork sandwich.

725
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,095
Rym: I like a little bit sort of like.

726
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:14,760
Scott: it's okay.

727
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,580
Scott: If the barbecue sauce is room temperature or warmer you can like dip a french fry in there.

728
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:20,200
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's real important, right?

729
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,559
Scott: But you know You don't want to add more to the already sauced up rib or pulled pork sandwich or whatever it is.

730
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:37,595
Rym: So when I was a kid I think my favorite barbecue was like regular like barbecue chicken like beer can chicken that kind of barbecue chicken Mmm, and that is still one of my favorite foods to this day.

731
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:38,640
Rym: Like that is not change.

732
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,746
Scott: I mean there the.

733
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:42,440
Scott: there are so many different kinds of barbecued food, right?

734
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,584
Scott: You got your your rib your chicken right your pulled pork But then you got the other.

735
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:54,928
Scott: you got the brisket which is like, oh the brisket watch out You're starting to get into good territories now, right and I feel like you know the best of the best.

736
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:59,443
Scott: like the the connoisseurs barbecue item is The burnt end.

737
00:50:59,904 --> 00:51:00,386
Rym: Oh my god.

738
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:04,036
Rym: So John Brown that the state there's one barbecue place like really near us.

739
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:05,420
Rym: It's like super super legit.

740
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:12,435
Rym: There's another one that we haven't like figured out where it is or if it's open yet Like what the deal is with it, but this place has burnt ends.

741
00:51:12,455 --> 00:51:13,700
Scott: This is a new place near me, too.

742
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,423
Scott: They haven't gone to.

743
00:51:14,464 --> 00:51:18,124
Rym: they people have said it's okay and they run out of the burnt ends Like they like.

744
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:20,520
Rym: they just run out of meat every day like they make their me.

745
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:26,545
Scott: Well, that's the thing is when it takes food so long to make right your Barbecue device whatever it is.

746
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:31,159
Scott: Usually a big metal thing outside out back behind your restaurant only holds so much meat.

747
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,337
Scott: So you fill it up literally all the way with meat.

748
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:41,186
Scott: and If people and then it takes a long time before anything's ready to sell at all Things are ready to sell.

749
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:46,439
Scott: so you start selling and as soon as a some of it, you know Freeze up some space you can put more in there.

750
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,395
Scott: But it might not be ready until like the next frickin day or something.

751
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:51,279
Scott: You don't even know how long you know.

752
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:57,580
Scott: Maybe if people are buying things like early before lunch, maybe you can put some more meats in there.

753
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,508
Scott: That'll be done for dinner.

754
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:04,760
Scott: But like you have a capacity And it's like that capacity might be enough for like people sitting in your restaurant.

755
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:12,641
Scott: But if people come in and get takeout It's like there's an infinite number of people can do that and then you're out of food and you it's gonna be time before there's More.

756
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:14,469
Scott: there's nothing you can really do about.

757
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:15,574
Scott: so I don't know what.

758
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,100
Scott: I have more more barbecues.

759
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:22,160
Rym: I don't know if it's just because we're talking about barbecue, but the chat is like lit over here.

760
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:23,206
Scott: I'm sure it is.

761
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:28,979
Rym: People are very passionate about barbecue for so Grover's real excited about going to the barbecue thing this weekend.

762
00:52:29,322 --> 00:52:31,360
Scott: Oh, so the bar let's talk about the barbecue thing this weekend.

763
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,480
Scott: So in New York every year and I missed it last year for I don't know what reason but I also missed it last year.

764
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:46,570
Scott: I've been to it almost I found him about it actually by accident I was biking around one day and bumped into it and then since then I put it on my calendar and I hit it every Year since then except last year.

765
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:50,269
Rym: I don't know why it's dangerous though If you bump into it biking because you're already hungry from biking.

766
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,216
Scott: So now I but what it is is the.

767
00:52:52,477 --> 00:53:03,537
Scott: it's the Big Apple barbecue, it's in Madison Square Park for one weekend a year in the summer usually June something and For two days Saturday and Sunday barbecue people from all over the country.

768
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:05,869
Scott: nay world Mostly us though.

769
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:12,300
Scott: I don't think there might be Canadian ones I don't even know think it's mostly us if not all but from all parts of the u.s.

770
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:22,340
Scott: They come and set up shop in Madison Square Park right on Friday They get those barbecues rolling and then Saturday morning at 11 out comes the food, right?

771
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:28,680
Scott: The way it works is you walk up to any booth you want and you shell out like 11 bucks or something.

772
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:36,529
Scott: They give you a you know, disposable food tray with a little bit of like maybe you know a little bit of rib Maybe like a quarter rack or less, right?

773
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,900
Scott: It might not be rib, you know might be a pulled pork sandwich.

774
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:40,550
Scott: It might be whatever that place is serving.

775
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,120
Scott: each place serves one or two things.

776
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:48,114
Scott: You know the side whatever their side is, you know and you walk away and eat it.

777
00:53:48,254 --> 00:53:53,499
Scott: and the popular ones that mad long lines Yep, and the not-so-popular ones you can just walk right up.

778
00:53:53,961 --> 00:54:03,220
Scott: They also sell these VIP passes which are even if you're rich and love barbecue more than life itself You should not buy one of these because they cost hundreds of dollars.

779
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:17,225
Scott: They entitle you to some like, you know free meals or you know, you're basically paying for meals in advance effectively But you could walk basically behind the booths to where they all have separate checkout lanes So you don't have to wait in line.

780
00:54:17,265 --> 00:54:27,102
Scott: you can go to basically the VIP line behind each booth to get food everywhere and Go like that, but you can only eat it like two or three places before you're full Unless you're.

781
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:30,477
Rym: well, I mean, so I think that is aimed at the Homer Simpsons.

782
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:31,280
Scott: Yes, sure.

783
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:34,379
Scott: So what I do is I go on Saturday at 11 before there's any lines.

784
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:48,548
Scott: I hit up my guy with his being the best maybe my favorite food on earth Maybe right and then I hit up one that I haven't hit up before because I've hit up a lot of them are repeats year to Yep And I try out to see if there's anything new out there.

785
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:52,080
Scott: and then I come back on Sunday and I do a little rerun.

786
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,954
Scott: And that's how I do except last year.

787
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:55,720
Scott: I missed it.

788
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,243
Scott: I don't know why.

789
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:59,220
Rym: probably just go Sunday this year because we're running that race Saturday morning.

790
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,290
Scott: Well, my plan is to bike to the race say hi.

00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,216

00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:11,137
Rym: Oh, yeah.

00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:11,860
Rym: I forgot about that.

795
00:55:12,864 --> 00:55:14,158
Scott: And then maybe bike back to you.

796
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:21,017
Scott: Yeah, cuz we're only hanging out of you and I could I could do all kinds of shit on Saturday and then Sunday My plan is bike to the barbecue.

798
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:25,409
Rym: I might do.

799
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:28,946
Scott: There's not a lot of things happening Sunday like there are We'll have our guests over.

800
00:55:28,986 --> 00:55:32,000
Rym: maybe I'll spring for them to get a city bike pass for the day so they can bike over.

801
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:33,929
Rym: Look, cuz I don't think they want to bring their bikes.

802
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:34,954
Scott: Oh a whole day.

803
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:36,320
Rym: Yeah, it's not too expensive.

804
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:38,729
Scott: Well, I'm gonna say Sunday at 11.

805
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:40,074
Scott: I'm gonna be in Madison Square Park.

806
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:41,860
Rym: Yeah, I will also be there.

807
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:43,789
Scott: What time is your race on Saturday?

808
00:55:44,452 --> 00:55:45,115
Rym: Ah, I don't remember.

809
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:45,718
Rym: It's morning ish.

810
00:55:45,778 --> 00:55:48,848
Rym: I think Well, we'll coordinate our business tomorrow.

811
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:49,591
Rym: Like what our deal is.

812
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:55,297
Rym: Mmm, but so the Debate they were having in the chat here was wait.

813
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,615
Rym: So the definitions just low and slow because they were saying what about like Turkish barbecue or the barbecues?

814
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:10,000
Rym: you like heat some stones And then put it next to the meat and I'd say that's all good If it's not cooked an indirect heat for a long time, there's another component you're forgetting probably with smoking.

815
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,940
Rym: I was about to say smoke is the critical component because otherwise you could argue that a slow cooker is barbecue.

816
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,215
Scott: And then it's yes, and it's uh, then it is some other kind of food.

817
00:56:19,717 --> 00:56:20,600
Scott: right that is not.

818
00:56:21,064 --> 00:56:22,699
Scott: You know in the barbecue smoke is key.

819
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:28,037
Rym: There's a reason liquid smoke exists as a thing even though it's carcinogenic and it's a preservative.

820
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:31,730
Rym: I Will take that hit I'll take that risk.

821
00:56:32,112 --> 00:56:34,179
Rym: I love the taste of smoke so much.

822
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:37,176
Scott: Yeah, barbecue is bad really bad for you, by the way.

823
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:49,560
Rym: Yeah I We know based on relatively recent research that red meat is bad in ways that we never imagined It's super bad like the fat and like all those pieces of it actually aren't so bad for you.

824
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,385
Rym: What's bad is the red meat part itself?

825
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:54,133
Scott: It's not as bad as tobacco though.

826
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:56,760
Scott: No, no, and I'm only how often do I eat it?

827
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,727
Scott: like Two or three times a year at most.

828
00:57:00,108 --> 00:57:02,255
Rym: Yeah, I I eat red meat.

829
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:09,908
Scott: I think I mean I mean barbecue specifically Red meat I eat maybe once or twice a month.

830
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:12,595
Rym: Yeah once a month for barbecue tops.

831
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,260
Rym: Yeah tops.

832
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:18,360
Scott: Well barbecue like maybe once every three months, but red meat once a month.

833
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,780
Rym: Well, if I eat barbecue, I go all out and I usually try to not eat.

834
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:29,060
Scott: Well, that's what I do is like if you know If I'm gonna eat a red meat or a barbecue, I'm gonna eat the best and I'm gonna go all out.

835
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,954
Scott: I'm not gonna eat some I'm not gonna eat some crap.

836
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:31,740
Scott: Oh burger, right?

837
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:34,327
Scott: I'll eat a burger if it is an amazo burger.

838
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,175
Rym: Yeah, you go to the Baroness or you eat a steak somewhere.

839
00:57:37,436 --> 00:57:38,780
Rym: Yep steak burger.

840
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:42,329
Rym: So what's your favorite of all the barbecue dishes?

841
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:43,935
Rym: Like what's your favorite that isn't burnt ends?

842
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:44,799
Rym: Cuz that's kind of like cheating.

843
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,350
Scott: See that actually the thing is here.

844
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,300
Scott: as a Jew pastrami is a deal.

845
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,869
Scott: Now you might be saying whoa pastrami is like a cured thing.

846
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,797
Scott: It's not a it's not a barbecue thing.

847
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:55,740
Rym: smoke pastrami.

848
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:05,945
Scott: There are places Barbecue places that are doling out the pastrami and let me tell you I'm into that and I don't care about what purist or Technicality thing you want to count.

849
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:07,611
Rym: that is so good.

850
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:13,010
Rym: when I was visiting up in Albany with Pete Nury a while Not too long ago smoke pastrami man.

851
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:14,557
Scott: I'm down with that.

852
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:16,504
Scott: That is my deal Right.

853
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:23,497
Rym: I remember that one time we were up in Albany We're gonna have that party and we decided we were gonna smoke prime rib for the fuck of it and eat that.

854
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:26,380
Scott: and then we went To the place to buy a meat and the dude talked us out of it.

855
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:26,943
Rym: He's like.

856
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:28,169
Scott: he's like you don't want no prime rib.

857
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:31,086
Scott: Just buy this like, you know buy this brisket You're gonna.

858
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,762
Rym: you're gonna waste that prime rib It's not.

859
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:35,036
Rym: the brisket will be way better and he did like.

860
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,272
Rym: he Literally like talked us out of this like talked us off the cliff.

861
00:58:39,412 --> 00:58:41,360
Scott: He's told us in the buying something cheaper.

862
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,500
Rym: So like okay, whatever we don't care, but in retrospect, I feel like we should have just smoked that prime rib and gone for it.

863
00:58:46,782 --> 00:58:48,420
Scott: Well, I mean we ate a delicious meat.

864
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,508
Scott: I didn't care what meat it was.

865
00:58:49,648 --> 00:58:51,300
Scott: other people were the ones who cared what meat it was.

866
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:54,100
Scott: I just really really wanted a delicious meat.

867
00:58:54,441 --> 00:59:06,660
Rym: I gotta tell you though the barbecue like kabob barbecue stuff that I had in Istanbul to this day Like I have never had I mean it's I would say that it is not better than American style barbecue in any absolute sense.

868
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:07,318
Rym: It's just great.

869
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:19,277
Rym: I have never had that style of barbecue as good as I had it in Istanbul because I've tried to get it from like every Turkish or like Mediterranean style place I've ever tried in the city never quite lives up.

870
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:23,832
Scott: Meanwhile, yeah I don't know like how come some foods cuz like there doesn't see.

871
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:27,285
Scott: people always try to find a reason you can't make a food In a certain place, right?

872
00:59:27,325 --> 00:59:30,780
Rym: Like you can't make New York bagels in a lot of places cuz the water's shitty.

873
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:31,745
Scott: I don't know about that.

874
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:33,554
Scott: I'm gonna find out if that's true or not.

875
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:34,639
Scott: Right, but that's what people say.

876
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:37,140
Rym: I'll bring you some water back from Arizona in a bucket.

877
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,220
Rym: But

878
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:53,840
Scott: obviously there's no reason you can't make good barbecue regardless of location because the people who make their barbecue far away Come to New York with their equipment and make the same goddamn barbecue They make in their home place, right and it tastes the same as it does if you go to the restaurant far away.

879
00:59:54,665 --> 01:00:02,340
Scott: so Why is it that like not one Turkish person who can make that good food has come to New York with the knowledge to make?

880
01:00:02,441 --> 01:00:03,953
Scott: It and done so here right?

881
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:04,740
Scott: It's New York City.

882
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,812
Scott: You've got pretty much every freaking thing right that you can think of.

883
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:09,418
Scott: someone has come here and brought it here.

884
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:15,015
Rym: Well, it's partly just that like we're you know Mexico with Mexican food and barbecue.

885
01:00:15,397 --> 01:00:25,217
Rym: when we went to San Antonio we were like, let's find the best goddamn barbecue and the best goddamn Mexican food and the best Mexican food there is about as good as the fancy Mexican food I get New York.

886
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:35,254
Rym: and So far none of the barbecue places we've tried in San Antonio are better than John Brown smokehouse Which is like right next to our house and John Brown smokehouse is.

887
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:35,858
Scott: it's pretty good.

888
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:37,946
Scott: Yeah It's not like the best barbecue ever.

889
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:39,030
Rym: pretty legit though.

890
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,772
Rym: Apparently that is.

891
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:41,117
Rym: it is Kansas style.

892
01:00:41,217 --> 01:00:41,899
Scott: Yeah, I like it.

893
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,733
Scott: I like like their cornbread is like ridiculously amazing cuz it's almost like.

894
01:00:46,753 --> 01:00:47,676
Scott: it's almost like a cake.

895
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:49,120
Rym: It's cornbread pudding.

896
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,364
Scott: It's like a giant cube.

897
01:00:50,485 --> 01:00:51,749
Scott: It's all super yellow.

898
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:53,335
Scott: It's super buttery and moist.

899
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:54,820
Scott: It's got big chunks of corn in it.

900
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,120
Scott: It's like the ultimate cornbread.

901
01:00:56,381 --> 01:01:05,740
Rym: It's just so hard that that place is there because it's right next to where we go bouldering and when I bike to work There's starting up like they're doing the smoking just as I'm going to work.

902
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,220
Rym: I smell it while I'm biking to work and I get crazy hungry.

903
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,169
Rym: Yeah, like I want to go in there.

904
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:17,170
Scott: But even if I just get a job there Yeah, you could just quit your job and grill instead.

905
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:25,980
Rym: I'm sure that being a barbecue Professional in a restaurant will make the exact same amount of money that being like a Wall Street product.

906
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:36,249
Scott: I'm willing to bet that the pit master Dudes who put their names all over these restaurants that come to Madison Square Park and will be there this weekend make a lot More money than you do but also more to the point.

907
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,895
Rym: I am pretty confident.

908
01:01:38,016 --> 01:01:39,060
Rym: I would become fat.

909
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:41,023
Scott: They are all fat.

910
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:44,051
Scott: I there are mostly fat old white dudes, but not all them.

911
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:48,054
Rym: Not all now, but mostly I feel like fat old white dude.

912
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:53,230
Rym: Explo expresses literally 90% of the pit masters I've ever met in my life.

913
01:01:53,591 --> 01:02:05,066
Rym: Mm-hmm Occasionally but Yeah, they're all Actually taken note over the years.

914
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:09,460
Scott: which of the places that show up there are not run by fat old white dudes?

915
01:02:10,262 --> 01:02:19,420
Scott: And they are particularly, you know, I don't know if they're the most delicious ones necessarily because I mean, you know Pretty much anyone who shows up there is great to begin with right?

916
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:25,620
Scott: They don't have any crappy people there, but their styles are definitely the most divergent, right?

917
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:26,785
Scott: It's like, you know, they don't.

918
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:31,248
Scott: all the white dudes are just trying to stick to what you know Just like with chili.

919
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,281
Rym: I like the same thing with chili that it with barbecue like.

920
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:34,448
Rym: there's all these specific like.

921

926
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:08,393
Rym: I had not only have no problem with that But that's usually some of my favorite barbecue Even though that stuff would net is there literally an entire article on birth.

927
01:03:08,653 --> 01:03:14,303
Rym: There's an entire Wikipedia page on burnt ends specifically, oh, baby Look at that.

928
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:19,960

929
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:22,044
Rym: All right, I think it's.
