1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,527
Rym: It's Wednesday February 11th.

2
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:12,230
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,379
Scott: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,608
Rym: tonight We review the new anime movie.

5
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:19,460
Rym: well new ish anime movie sword of the stranger.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:36,299
Rym: So after the New York comic-con we thought hey we came into the city We want to do something other than just the con.

8
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,429
Rym: otherwise you know why'd we take the train into the city?

9
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:38,610
Rym: so?

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,096
Rym: We figured we'd go and see Coraline.

11
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:44,087
Scott: and well first we figured we go to the sushi conveyor belt.

12
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,578
Scott: well Gorge ourselves The expensive place.

13
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:54,459
Rym: before that even we decided hey Let's get up early go into the city go downtown and get some dim sum.

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,174
Rym: and I think we all woke up independently and said yeah Going back to sleep.

15
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:02,630
Scott: I could have done the dim sum, but no one else was gonna.

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,678
Scott: You can't really dim sum on your own that doesn't.

17
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:05,542
Scott: it doesn't work.

18
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,630
Scott: - yeah, it doesn't like dim sum for one.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,476
Scott: They're like huh usually it's like.

20
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,500
Scott: you know dim sum for eight.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,390
Scott: That's more the correct number plus dim sum for one.

22
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:17,006
Rym: You're just gonna find me dead with like nine empty egg custard plates.

23
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:18,815
Scott: I know right It's like that's.

24
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:25,790
Scott: the other thing is that you want to get a variety when you dim sum You don't want to get a whole bunch of one thing, but the smallest servings are like four dumplings.

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,710
Scott: So it's like if you take the dumplings you got to eat four of them.

26
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,793
Scott: But if you got four people you can eat one dumpling of each guy And you're all good.

27
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:34,937
Rym: so we ate the.

28
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:38,349
Rym: we had a ton of kaiten sushi like probably more than we should have.

29
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,996
Rym: I had an Unnecessarily large beer like it was.

30
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:45,985
Rym: it was larger than was prudent shall we say.

31
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,610
Scott: it was a salaryman's beer.

32
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,133
Scott: It was.

33
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,890
Rym: it was the kind of thing where you got to drink it slam it down on the table and go.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,737
Rym: But alright we we did that and we wanted to do something else and call it a night.

35
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,747
Rym: so alright Let's head down to the AMC.

36
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,515
Rym: Let's see Carlisle in 3d.

37
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:02,138
Rym: I'm excited.

38
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:07,250
Scott: normally I don't want to go to the movie theater so much unless it's something I'm not gonna see.

39
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:13,437
Scott: otherwise yeah Such as the topic of the show or a 3d movie, which I can never see at home cuz it's 3d.

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,795
Rym: It was crazy because we also just went to see the movie.

41
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:19,583
Rym: We're talking about tonight I know right.

42
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,752
Scott: so it's like I hadn't been to a movie theater.

43
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,218
Scott: I get that wasn't you know?

44
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:28,152

Rym: Yeah, the point is we also.

49
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,180
Rym: it was kind of a decadent weekend.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,386
Rym: We took cabs everywhere.

51
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,020
Rym: cuz when there's three people it's really not that much more.

52
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,597
Scott: We're going crosstown and going to places.

53
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:58,120
Scott: with that You know you could only get to buy cab feet and bus plus cab like eight bucks.

54
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:04,557
Rym: Bus fare for three people six bucks well free because I have infinite bus fine four bucks.

55
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:05,119
Rym: cuz I don't.

56
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:16,370
Rym: okay I don't take buses all right But all right, so we take a cab over to the AMC and we go in and five o'clock showing sold out But there's a 710. so all right.

57
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,791

Rym: It's Sunday.

61
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:24,420
Rym: That means I have to be up at work at like 430. so now I can't do it.

62
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,538
Rym: I'd already stayed up late every other night that week.

63
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,140
Rym: it was And think about this because I went to the New York comic-con Saturday and Sunday, and I stayed out late Friday.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,182
Rym: I basically went into the city every day with no break for last week the weekend and now this week Wasn't?

65
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,790
Rym: I wasn't doing well, so I bailed.

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,252
Rym: I totally.

67
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:45,875
Rym: just I bailed.

68
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:46,820
Rym: I walked out.

69
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,267
Rym: I was gonna take the train home and go to bed.

70
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,956
Rym: so Scott and Emily all right.

71
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:50,800
Rym: They're gonna stick around.

72
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,386
Rym: They're gonna see the 710 showing.

73
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,354
Rym: they're debating the logistics of this.

74
00:03:54,374 --> 00:04:01,092
Rym: they're standing at the kiosk and Apparently it's sold out while they were buying the tickets.

75
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:04,142
Scott: Yeah, I mean I put it's a touchscreen to buy tickets You know.

76
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,147
Scott: so there's no actual ticket selling people.

77
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:14,071
Scott: so I push the buttons, and I'm like tickets 7 o'clock to Purchase slide card, and it's like sold out.

78
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:14,533
Scott: Sorry.

79
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:21,459
Scott: I'm like what I go back to the screen And it's at 7 o'clock sold out, and I'm like huh it must have sold out while I was pushing the buttons.

80
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:23,883
Rym: So fail.

81
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:32,299
Rym: we all walk back to Grand Central together in time to see that we have had the worst possible timing for a train that we could have possibly had.

82
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:39,082
Scott: Yeah, we pretty much showed up at the train station, and it's like the train going to Beacon left Just now.

83
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:42,980
Scott: so we got to sit there for like an hour until we can get on the next train.

84
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:49,779
Rym: Yeah, I like went up to my office across the street and surf the internet for a while and got a drink And it was it was a good time.

85
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:59,665
Rym: Yeah We're not really gonna cover the New York Comic Con so much yet because I got to put together all the interviews I got And suffice to say it was it was fun It was what the New York Comic Con is.

86
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:04,620
Rym: their gaming content was not the kind of gaming content you get from a gaming con.

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:17,440
Scott: It was a whole bunch of booths a lot of which were selling comics some you know selling old comics some selling news I'm selling cheap some selling expensive some selling junk, but they're gaming content.

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:28,860
Rym: They really hyped it up, but it was basically the showroom portion of packs But there was no play games portion to go along with it Mmm, so it was like you could go play the new Ghostbusters game or fear - and all these things.

89
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,298
Rym: I did a bunch of that, but there was no like Luke cranes running a burning wheel game.

90
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:33,740
Rym: check it out.

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,039
Scott: Well upstairs in the upstairs part was like oh, yeah, I went up there.

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,985

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,913
Rym: they had that.

97
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:52,271
Rym: yeah had that covered if you wanted To play a while raid very slowly with pen and paper Yep, but they had that covered.

98
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:58,500
Scott: They did not have You know like big open area with a bunch of tables and a bunch of board games.

99
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,675
Rym: I got to say more.

100
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:04,715
Scott: of course It's a comic con so I mean wad see is pretty much the extent of the gaming you can expect.

101
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:13,179
Rym: it amazes me That Connecticut is Fast becoming the best gaming con I attend and it is a lot of gaming con.

102
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,216
Scott: well We got to go to those decks slash dreamation cons in North Jersey.

103
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:18,979
Scott: see what they're like.

104
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:19,320
Rym: yeah.

105
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:28,633
Rym: But I'm both excited and leery of things like that because I used to go to a lot of because their website looks like it's A very larper ish our way kind of situation.

106
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:29,818
Scott: You know what I'm saying well.

107
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,691
Rym: part of it Too is that those are very old-school.

108
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:38,658
Rym: gaming convention is indeed yes I used to go to a lot of gaming cons before I went to anime cons or even knew they existed.

109
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:39,485
Rym: you're living in Michigan.

110
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,235
Rym: I'd go to like Michigan when I was in middle school and play D&D with a bunch of 40 year old guys.

111
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,599
Rym: and you know hang out there.

112
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,640

113
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:53,972
Rym: they dropped me off at some convention center and pick me up a day later and have no idea where I was and what I was up to.

114
00:06:54,033 --> 00:07:02,980
Rym: but those cons There's a certain time in your life when they're fun And I don't know if I can deal with old-school gaming cons anymore.

115
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:04,284
Scott: I don't know.

116
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:04,806

00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,343
Rym: Oh and also gave in Taika over there and We talked to them.

152
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:16,232
Scott: we learned about how they handle the booths.

153
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:22,940
Rym: they handle their booth pretty much the same way We handle our booth except that they have people who are paid to deal with stuff.

154
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:30,140
Scott: The other problem with them handling their booth the way we handle our booth is that it's not easy to talk to them.

155
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,308
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you come up and talk to us at a con especially if we have a table half the time We'll be like yeah, that's great.

156
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,856
Rym: Yeah, we got to go and then we disappear.

157
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:45,027
Scott: yeah And so you know us actually legitimately trying to talk to them for reals Not gonna work out too.

158
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:46,918
Scott: Well when they're at the booth because they're just like uh-huh.

159
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:50,971
Rym: yep One great secret one little tidbit that I did discover.

160
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:53,780
Rym: it's more gaming stuff, but I think they were coached by Robert coup.

161
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:55,629
Rym: I think they were too, but I got to get this out there.

162
00:09:56,293 --> 00:10:06,540
Rym: at the penny arcade expo We we brought up burning wheel at the Q&A thing and I remember that Taiko I'll use the there soon is I think yeah, they're stage names.

163
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,267
Scott: He said specifically burning wheel is the shit.

164
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:10,330
Scott: that is what he said.

165
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,035
Rym: said those words exactly.

166
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,819
Rym: there are videos of it mm-hmm.

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,328
Rym: So on Saturday, I went up to the table.

168
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:22,304
Rym: I was like you guys are awesome blah blah blah, so you said burning wheels awesome blah blah blah and The.

169
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,239
Rym: he looked like a deer in headlights.

170
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,146
Rym: He was like oh shit.

171
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:29,398
Rym: Oh shit, and he had no idea what I was talking about.

172
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:38,942
Rym: no clue But don't worry we've got machinations along that front And I've got a ton of interviews and there will be New York comic-con coverage in The future.

173
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:49,421
Rym: if you really want to know what happened at the con, and you can't wait another two weeks Search for New York comic-con and they have a link to like all the coverage in the world and all the YouTube videos in The world.

174
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,046
Scott: yeah, really.

175
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,878
Scott: It's mostly people buying stuff people talking to artists.

176
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,864
Scott: You know That kind of thing.

177
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,089
Scott: this you know it's a comic-con.

178
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:58,892
Scott: It's a bunch of booths.

179
00:10:58,952 --> 00:10:59,575
Scott: It's not like.

180
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:00,760
Scott: you know events.

181
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:07,340
Rym: Well, no There's a ton of events But only if the problem with comic cons really is that the events are usually there.

182
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,610
Rym: They'd be really fun to go to like.

183
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:17,969
Rym: I'd love to go to a lot of these panels But you either have to be press so you can just skip the line or wait for like two hours Even then or pay five bucks.

184
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:19,034
Scott: a lot of the panels.

185
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,467
Scott: You know they're not fan panels They're industry panels, and they're mostly just.

186
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,274
Scott: you know they're not so exciting.

187
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:26,060
Scott: unless you're really into whatever.

188
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:27,507
Scott: It is that you know.

189
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,317
Scott: these people running the panel do like.

190
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:29,719
Scott: if you're.

191
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:34,300
Rym: you know I am because the IGN theater had a bunch of Astro Boy stuff, and they had oh, yeah, that was the theater.

192
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,931
Scott: That's just mostly showings.

193
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,280
Scott: It's basically a video room.

194
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,518
Rym: They also had some early releases of trailers and things and a lot of people saw Astro Boy stuff.

195
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:43,802
Rym: that made them Hopeful.

196
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,691
Scott: as to the movie yeah, but I mean anything.

197
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,095
Scott: you all trailers.

198
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,720
Scott: It's very easy to make a hopeful trailer.

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,400
Scott: It's very hard.

200
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:54,840
Rym: I Point out to you the Dragon Ball live-action trailer.

201
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,188
Rym: Yeah, someone thinks that's good.

202
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,937
Scott: someone thinks that they Dragon Ball fans think it's good.

203
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:00,759
Rym: No they don't.

204
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:04,099
Scott: Those aren't real Dragon Ball fans.

205
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,206
Rym: Anyway, do you got any news here?

206
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:14,160
Scott: well actually there was a news a comic news at the comic-con?

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,582
Scott: That while is not so exciting I think.

208
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:22,036
Scott: but there is something that I'm sort of going huh, maybe about.

209
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,160
Rym: right man died again.

210
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,745
Rym: Well, no Batman died.

211
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:26,271
Scott: no Batman's gonna die.

212
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:26,833
Rym: I don't know.

213
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,900
Scott: actually I don't know Batman actually might be dead.

214
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,906
Scott: I forget what the deal is.

215
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:32,000
Scott: I'm not I don't pay that much attention.

216
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:34,902
Scott: But there was like some comics called like Batman Rises and Batman Rises Rest in peace.

217
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:39,156
Scott: and I think there's some comics called like battle for the cowl or something.

218
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,320
Scott: so I think there is like.

219
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,140
Scott: But I think Batman died and everyone else is like fighting over who is bad or something like that.

220
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,682
Scott: I don't know.

221
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:50,019
Rym: clearly that's only happening in an alternate universe that eventually will collapse into the real.

222
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,461
Scott: yeah I have.

223
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,289
Scott: no I have no clue.

224
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,228
Scott: That's like that's like hints I get from like pictures.

225
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:56,640
Scott: you know what I'm gonna say that I might have seen for like a second.

226
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,654
Rym: I have my own personal can't like Rym cannon Batman.

227
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:01,477
Rym: It's pretty simple.

228
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,816
Rym: it is Beat ass followed by the Dark Knight Returns, and there's no other Batman.

229
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:13,009
Scott: alright, so spider-man right Spider-man spider-man right.

230
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:15,460
Scott: so if you don't read Marvel Comics?

231
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,443
Scott: You probably don't know this.

232
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,272
Scott: if you do read Marvel Comics you almost definitely know this right.

233
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:29,800
Scott: there are regular old Marvel Comics like you know Amazing spider-man or the Avengers or x-men right and then they have these ultimates And it's like ultimate spider-man ultimate x-men.

234
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:36,200
Scott: You know ultimate whatever right and the ultimate ones are sort of separate right like a few years ago.

235
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,668
Scott: They started with like ultimate spider-man number one.

236
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,080
Scott: it had nothing to do with anything else that you know.

237
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Scott: I mean they were sort of retelling the same stories, but it wasn't the same.

238
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:57,683
Scott: you know it was different, and it was sort of like a clean slate and That way it would be really easy for someone to sort of you know catch up on the whole thing without reading comics going back To the 60s.

239
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:05,420
Scott: you know you can just read ultimate spider-man, and it's available in trades And it's all modern and you know relatively recent so you can just get all of it.

240
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,686
Scott: So it was no problem.

241
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:09,179
Scott: Just read all the issues of ultimate spider-man.

242
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:18,240
Scott: so what they're doing apparently is You know they're going to stop all the ultimate books.

243
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,886
Scott: They're like you know gonna be like up.

244
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,599
Scott: That's it, and they're gonna reset them to number one again.

245
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:29,039
Rym: Now at first though are they gonna retcon this BS together into something or what?

246
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,560
Scott: well You know the ultimate stuff all on its own sort of goes together.

247
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,720
Scott: It's like a self-contained cohesive unit right and now they're resetting the cohesive unit.

248
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:41,524
Scott: So I was like huh, you know Maybe is it just?

249
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:42,950
Scott: they're just gonna keep doing that.

250
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,663
Scott: that way you can sort of get on to these like short things And then you know they can.

251
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:47,647
Scott: I don't know.

252
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:53,206
Scott: but apparently the deal is it's actually when even though It's resetting to number one.

253
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:58,628
Scott: It's still gonna be the same ultimate universe Just fast forward in like two years.

254
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:03,754
Scott: You know two fictional years in the future from whatever year It is in the ultimate universe, huh?

255
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:09,720
Scott: So if you've never read them before you'll be able to just start reading at the new number one.

256
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:20,375
Scott: I have a. but if you have read the old ultimate you know and now you're reading the new ultimate after it resets You'll sort of see some stuff that other people don't see.

257
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,620
Rym: I have a hunch.

258
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:30,812
Rym: My guess is that within ten issues there is going to be very important stuff from previous ones That's gonna come back in and what makes sense to new readers at all.

259
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,324
Scott: Yeah, I think it's sort of like hey You're a new reader.

260
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,475
Scott: come and read the ultimate universe.

261
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,245
Scott: you reset it for you But they didn't really.

262
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,615
Scott: but then you're gonna.

263
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:40,625
Scott: you know They're basically you're gonna have to.

264
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:48,494
Scott: then they'll hook you in and they'll hook you in to going back Right and buying all the trades of the original ultimate universe.

265
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,718
Rym: We're definitely gonna start seeing.

266
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,826
Rym: see Issue 289 Marvel X.

267
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,114
Scott: No, actually there's actually a lot of discussion about those.

268
00:15:56,214 --> 00:16:03,882
Rym: see, you know issue number things Right, we know when I first was reading comics that were they were all over the place until I saw one of those Which I didn't.

269
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,488
Rym: I didn't actually see one right away.

270
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,335
Rym: I thought that was a joke.

271
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,800
Rym: I didn't think that actually happened.

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,780
Scott: No, no, see the thing is right that they stopped doing that around the late 90s early, you know They just don't have those anymore, right?

273
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,660
Scott: so the problem with that is They didn't change the way they wrote the comics.

274
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:30,634
Scott: So basically you would read something Someone would make a reference to something that happened in some other issue and there's no little note.

275
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:35,628
Scott: They're saying, you know see issue 36 for more info.

276
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:38,240
Scott: Stan the man, you know that didn't that wasn't there.

277
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,531
Scott: So now you just have no fucking clue and you don't even know where to look.

278
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,920
Scott: so it's like should they keep those in?

279
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,366
Scott: It to be stupid and corny?

280
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:46,872
Scott: should they take them out?

281
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:58,105
Rym: You know what the correct answer is Have stories together such that you don't just like the green arrow shouldn't just randomly show up out of nowhere and he hasn't been in the story yet.

282
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:04,407
Rym: and then the only way that makes sense is if you know that he was involved in Some other comic and that's why he's there.

283
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,818
Rym: Yeah, you know proper storytelling.

284
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:07,259
Rym: I don't know.

285
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:15,883
Scott: Yeah, I feel don't assume, you know If someone's reading a book you have to assume that they have not read any other book ever and you have to do that for Every single book.

286
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:27,140
Scott: now, that doesn't mean you know, like with the Stan Lee book where every single issue They take three pages to describe, you know, the origin story and how they got their powers and what powers they have.

287
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:40,280
Scott: You know every single issue be that's a little bit unnecessary Right, but you know, it's still very very possible You know to tell us and if you know, you can't you know do that in a single issue.

288
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,257
Scott: They don't have issues, you know have trades.

289
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:46,643
Scott: only You know if Don't print.

290
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:51,280
Scott: It's every self-contained unit you publish needs to stand alone.

291
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:55,537
Scott: So if an issue is too small to stand alone, you shouldn't have the issue.

292
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:56,260
Scott: It just shouldn't exist.

293
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:04,433
Rym: But anyway, uh one thing if they actually just reset if they would ever just say look We are making a new comic called spider-man.

294
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:05,860
Rym: It's starting with issue one.

295
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:13,120
Rym: It is in no way in any way connected to any previous work that we have ever published.

296
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,039
Scott: That's what I did with the first ultimate spider-man.

297
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:16,804
Rym: But now.

298
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,720
Scott: but now it's connected to all the other ultimate books.

299
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,284
Rym: Yeah, so great.

300
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:26,960
Scott: And now the new ultimate spider-man which is gonna be number one again will be somewhat connected to the old alt.

301
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:32,499
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know They did do exactly what you just said when they came out with the ultimate universe years ago.

302
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,866
Rym: Spider-man, I can't I don't.

303
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:38,398
Rym: I don't want to read x-factor x-force and x-caliber to find out what you don't.

304
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,045
Scott: you only have to read Ultimate, you know.

305
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:44,749
Scott: and the thing is you really don't have to read all the ultimate books You just have to read some of the other ultimate books.

306
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,573
Rym: That's already.

307
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:46,759
Rym: I'm not happy with that.

308
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:54,040
Scott: Yeah It's like, you know They made a new universe that was smaller and self-contained and you can easily get all of it.

309
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:03,498
Rym: But I read x-men and then during the executioner song I read x-factor because it told me to and then I read x-force and then I I found out about x-caliber.

310
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:04,682
Rym: then I quit reading Comics.

311
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:10,000
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know when someone reads Naruto all they ask is that you read Naruto, right?

312
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:21,099
Rym: And if you need to tell a story about some other characters Imagine if Naruto like suddenly Goku shows up and like saves the day and then says something cryptic to our know And then you're gonna go right now.

313
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:27,580
Scott: It's like if you need to say, you know say concentrate on the villains of Naruto for like a few chapters, right?

314
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:37,474
Scott: You don't put out another separate manga called, you know, Naruto villains, you know number one and say yeah This takes place in between Naruto chapters 36 and whatever.

315
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:47,740
Scott: You just make the next chapter of Naruto be that You know instead of if you need x-men to cross over with spider-man, right?

316
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,420
Scott: Don't take you know, don't tell people who read spider-man to go read a certain x-men issue.

317
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:57,599
Scott: Just take that issue and make it the next issue of spider-man.

318
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,262
Scott: You know they do.

319
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:02,300
Rym: you know how they could still make money if they did that if they released him in trades instead of issues?

320
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:07,699
Rym: Oh, yeah, so it was big stories then like they're the spider-man trade one, two, three, four, five six.

321
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,506
Rym: Spider-man trade seven is Also the crossover with blah.

322
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,620
Rym: So if you read blah seven, it's also the crossover with spider-man.

323
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,724
Scott: So it was saying so.

324
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:20,694
Scott: basically it would be like this is spider-man volume seven.

325
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,420
Scott: This is also x-men volume three.

326
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,540
Rym: Yes, and if you want to make money you publish them with different covers in separate lines.

327
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,052
Scott: So the nerds buy both but they have the exact almost the exact same thing in the hook.

328
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:31,373
Scott: Yes.

329
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,300
Rym: Yeah, it's it's foolproof.

330
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:38,859
Scott: Yeah, that's you know, that is actually somewhat better than you know what they do all right.

331
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,504
Rym: anyway I don't we don't.

332
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:43,630
Rym: I don't really want to belabor this point because yeah I think you all know how we feel about these issues.

333
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,180
Scott: Yeah, I think I will buy the new Number one just the one issue because I get it at a huge discount.

334
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,071
Scott: Just to you know, check the deal to know what's going on.

335
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:59,912
Scott: I'm Brian that I'm gonna buy number two But I got you know, it's gonna cost me like a dollar.

336
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,116
Scott: So I'll check it.

337
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,083
Rym: All right I got a bunch of quickies here because I feel like they're all worth mentioning But they're not.

338
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,474
Rym: I don't have a lot to say about them penguin.

339
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:09,779
Rym: No, Monda is getting a movie.

340
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:11,303
Scott: I like penguin.

341
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,165
Rym: Oh man, I do too.

342
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,429
Rym: So I'm kind of excited about this.

343
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:16,358
Rym: I'll I expect it to be fansubbed and I hope to see it.

344
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:26,071
Rym: Spice and wolf which was a show that had one great episode and then never went anywhere and Stopped watching it and it turns out it's crap.

345
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,840
Rym: Yeah has a sequel.

346
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,265
Scott: Yeah, you know there's a lot more.

347
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:35,240
Scott: it feels like there's a lot more anime sequels lately and a lot less new shows.

348
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:43,838
Scott: You know, I keep seeing like such and such and such, you know, Monogatari such and such and such guy Dan You know, it's like alright, really?

349
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,364
Rym: Those are just words though.

350
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,993
Scott: I mean the thing is at least they.

351
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,320
Rym: that's like saying Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star online.

352
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,463
Rym: That is one thing.

353
00:21:52,664 --> 00:22:12,326
Scott: one thing I can say though about a lot of these anime though is the sequels is that they actually cover Them up with like clever names for the sequels rather than just calling them two, you know, or three or you know They actually change the name of it or they put a colon like it'll be such and such colon something instead of just such and such.

354
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:16,644
Rym: - but seriously the first episode of Spice and Wolf.

355
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:21,700
Rym: I actually despite the fact that I expected it to be some crap moe a relationship garbage show.

356
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:26,537
Rym: It was really like good and well animated and cool and the style was good.

357
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:27,360
Rym: The atmosphere was great.

358
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,665
Rym: I thought it was a great episode.

359
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:38,311
Rym: I expected a lot from that show surprisingly and then I learned to never Reset my hopes higher ever From my initial expectations of anything.

360
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,500
Scott: I just expectations low.

361
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:46,314
Rym: They were so low and it the first episode was enough to let me reconsider.

362
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,058
Rym: and I was so wrong.

363
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:50,006
Rym: that show went Nowhere.

364
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,476
Rym: and now it's getting a sequel.

365
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:52,120
Rym: Why?

366
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,187
Scott: Well, everything's getting a sequel.

367
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,231
Scott: I think it's just because they don't.

368
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,176
Scott: I don't know.

369
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,060
Scott: they risk averse.

370
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,720
Scott: You know, usually when people are risk averse they go with the sequels instead of with the new properties that are you know much riskier.

371
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:07,379
Rym: And I got one more bit here Akira Toriyama.

372
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,567
Scott: Okay, I think you're talking about Akira.

373
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:16,149
Rym: No saw the trailer Kineta For the Dragon Ball live-action movie.

374
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:17,071
Scott: that oh DC.

375
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,055
Scott: Well, so he did.

376
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,820
Scott: does he does nothing to do with the live-action?

377
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:21,567
Scott: He didn't know it exists or what?

378
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:36,098
Rym: Well, he saw the trailer and and I'll give you the quote but one if you have not seen this trailer yet It is the feeling that you will get is identical to the joke in animators Nina about a live-action Pokemon.

379
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:38,998
Rym: Yeah like Good God.

380
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,863
Rym: But he had this to say.

381
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:44,650
Rym: I'm quoting the translated statement as the original creator.

382
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,993
Rym: I had a feeling of huh?

383
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:55,040
Scott: I Don't even like Dragon Ball, but if the guy who made Dragon Ball it says, huh?

384
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,688
Rym: Actually the quote goes on.

385
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,614
Rym: that was out of context.

386
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:09,399
Rym: basically says but you know These are all ultra high caliber people and maybe it might be a way for the fans to appreciate it as a new Dragon Ball of a different dimension.

387
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:14,743
Rym: Perhaps this might become the great masterpiece of power Uh-huh.

388
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:15,867
Rym: It's hard to tell.

389
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:21,386
Scott: I think if you want to appreciate some Akira Toriyama, I think you should Look for some doctor slob.

390
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,873
Scott: Oh, yeah, or you should.

391
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,420
Scott: you know, you know place in Chrono Trigger.

392
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,971
Rym: I don't admit the original Dragon Ball is pretty funny.

393
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:32,276
Scott: The regular old Dragon Ball not Dragon Ball Z not Dragon Ball GT.

394
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,044
Rym: Dragon Ball is pretty fun

395
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:47,396
Scott: regular old Dragon Ball if you understand it and as a comedy and you get the jokes especially if you can, you know read the manga first of all and Get you know, there's a lot of Japanese jokes in there that are harder to get.

396
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,316
Scott: if you can do that That's pretty worthwhile.

397
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,960
Scott: but Dragon Ball Z anime.

398
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:54,784
Scott: It's not happening.

399
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,612
Scott: Nah, so I got.

400
00:24:56,632 --> 00:25:01,190
Scott: if you're gonna do if you're gonna watch a fighting thing At least watch just like fist in the North Star is like this.

401
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,294
Scott: at least heads explode.

402
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:03,760
Rym: So I at least I got.

403
00:25:04,682 --> 00:25:06,231
Rym: Bring up one more thing.

404
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,740
Rym: This is just too crazy.

405
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:11,073
Rym: So this is a little bit old but not many people have seen it.

406
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:19,630
Rym: unless you dig through anime news network konami claims that upper deck is Counterfeiting Yugioh cars.

407
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:20,396
Scott: Wait a minute.

408
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:26,215
Scott: usually Counterfeit, I mean there have been counterfeit cards since you know way even before magic.

409
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:26,596
Scott: right.

410
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:31,350
Rym: konami is suing Upper deck, I mean who distributes yugioh?

411
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,740
Scott: counterfeit cards were always like, you know shady dude in the mall.

412
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,380
Scott: They were never upper deck legitimate card maker.

413
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:42,079
Rym: No as I I don't understand what's going on because that gets really complicated.

414
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,920
Rym: like Upper deck sued them back and there's this other company involved now and everything's going crazy.

415
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:59,051
Rym: but as far as I can tell my my guess and I there is no Defamation libel or slander here at all because this is a random guess from an uninformed, dude Saying that right now.

416
00:25:59,111 --> 00:25:59,354
Rym: Okay.

417
00:25:59,374 --> 00:25:59,939
Rym: I want to get sued.

418
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:20,382
Rym: My best guess is that upper deck might have been just printing Counterfeits or allowing counterfeits to be printed and or distributed through them in order to get around some internal licensing or quantity deal with konami and there was probably some.

419
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:26,681
Rym: basically there was probably a very tenuous business relationship between all these companies and It was.

420
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:29,900
Rym: the business relationship was probably basically just a beehive.

421
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:30,622
Rym: Yeah I don't know.

422
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:35,713
Rym: and someone came over and knocked that beehive over Coming out.

423
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:42,940
Scott: see I don't I'm out of collectible cards games, you know, so I really don't pay attention so much and quote.

424
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,915
Scott: So I don't even know like who you know who makes which who publishes which games.

425
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,560
Scott: all I know is that Watsy makes magic.

426
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:50,839
Rym: That's seriously no hearing.

427
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,503
Rym: That's the name.

428
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:55,091
Rym: upper deck really surprised me.

429
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,799
Rym: I did not expect upper deck to be involved in something like this.

430
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,750
Scott: Yeah, it's they're a legitimate game maker.

431
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,220
Scott: Why would they be counterfeiting cards, you know?

432
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:04,244
Scott: So it's.

433
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:04,445
Scott: it's.

434
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:05,649
Scott: that's pretty strange.

435
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:18,786
Rym: I don't know what the you know, the real Identified upper deck as the source of 22 counterfeit rare cards being repackaged and sold by vintage And I don't know.

436
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:25,059
Rym: of course they go on to say this threatens to undermine the integrity of the game Including because the game has integrity.

437
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:37,279
Rym: Well, see, I don't think they are aware of the fact that the champion at yugioh in Rochester New York was none other than a 20 ounce already opened bottle of vanilla coke.

438
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:43,200
Rym: That cat that bottle of vanilla coke won one of the biggest yugioh tournaments in Rochester.

439
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:47,210
Scott: Yeah, they sure did and you might think over him.

440
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,839
Rym: No, I'm I'm not kidding to a degree that you would be surprised about.

441
00:27:52,294 --> 00:27:54,443
Scott: so Yeah, I don't know.

442
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:59,440
Scott: I just this actually thinking about this story got me, you know thinking again, right?

443
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:05,618
Scott: What if there was a collectible card game, right Just like, you know magic or whatever, right?

444
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,886
Scott: But there were actually anyone who wanted to.

445
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:21,420
Scott: it was an open gaming system and anyone who wanted to could print cards and any card That was actually printed properly and you know couldn't be wasn't marked on the back that it's not a in any way.

446
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,445
Rym: But that's got that simple.

447
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:23,813
Rym: That's not a collectible card game.

448
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:24,999
Rym: It's a customizable card game.

449
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:32,420
Rym: Well, I mean, they're all CCG's customizable collectible card, but customizable and collectible are possibly exclusive to one another.

450
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,460
Scott: Mmm, I guess it would make it, you know, there wouldn't be any a lot of collecting going on.

451
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,094
Rym: You wouldn't have to worry there would be.

452
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:45,174
Rym: no, you know The old magic the gathering problem of I have more money than all my friends.

453
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,097
Rym: I bought the best deck.

454
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:46,660
Rym: I always win.

455
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:57,060
Scott: Yeah, but then again, you know, the thing is you would have to have the cards, you know You couldn't just print the cards yourself unless you had a really really good printer because they would stand out from the other cards.

456
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,039
Scott: Well, it had to be printed.

457
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:08,840
Scott: You know the answer is to make it a game that can be played on either laptops or yes, but I was thinking right Let's say there were like three or four companies that were all publishing like Yu-Gi-Oh cards, right?

458
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,948
Scott: Yeah It would be this crazy race of like.

459
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,240
Scott: every company would try to make more and more ludicrous cards Like they would all just make I win cards.

460
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:21,372
Scott: That way you would buy from their their expansions instead of the other people's expansions.

461
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,057
Scott: it would get really silly.

462
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,525
Rym: Oh, okay There's a little more information here.

463
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:25,726
Rym: Now.

464
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:33,184
Rym: All right, the lawsuit originally actually was filed against ten John Doe's uh-huh, and Recently, they amended it.

465
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:40,326
Rym: dough number one and two are now upper decks to operations in California and Nevada Mm-hmm.

466
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:42,180
Rym: There are still eight more John Doe's.

467
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,912
Rym: This is a wide and and frightening ring of counterfeit.

468
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,136
Rym: and one last thing.

469
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,360
Rym: they've got a picture here.

470
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,459
Rym: I don't know if this is legit, but on animators Network There's a picture of a authentic card and a counterfeit card.

471
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:57,992
Rym: The counterfeit card looks like I printed it out out of an inkjet.

472
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:05,540
Scott: Yeah, so if upper deck was doing it Why wouldn't the counterfeit cards be basically exactly identical to real cards?

473
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,529
Rym: Well, here's a posit if you will.

474
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,177
Scott: in fact, they wouldn't be counterfeit.

475
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:12,680
Scott: They would just be Extra printings or hit him at cars.

476
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:24,216
Rym: enterprising individual who worked at one of these upper decks was taking the files used to make these and Using them on a shitty printer printing extras and then selling them.

477
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,360
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the thing.

478
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,644
Scott: It's like his.

479
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:27,246
Scott: Konami.

480
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:30,936
Scott: tell upper deck exactly how many of each cards are allowed that they do.

481
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,323
Scott: it's sort of crazy I'll bet they do.

482
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:35,269
Scott: I you know, it could be.

483
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:38,057
Scott: I'm feeling there's some sort of situation here of.

484
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:44,633
Scott: you know Konami, you know gave upper deck the license to print the Yu-Gi-Oh cards in the u.s.

485
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:49,492
Scott: Right, but now they're like Hey, we should print them ourselves and make more money.

486
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:51,060
Scott: Oh, we need to get our project to stop.

487
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:56,700
Rym: You know that sort of thing, but at the same time these counterfeit cards seem to actually exist.

488
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,779
Scott: Yeah, but I mean anyone could make counterfeit cards.

489
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,527
Rym: Yeah, but it's just I don't.

490
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:04,740
Rym: there's too many bees coming out of this hive and I can't figure out what's going on.

491
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,402
Rym: It's not?

492
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:09,577
Scott: I have no clue what the deal is because I don't even know who makes the stupid card.

493
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:22,466
Rym: and no no But anyway, it's not the bees it's things of the day.

494
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:25,496
Rym: so mm-hmm I got a lame one because I thought it was cool.

495
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:35,280
Rym: Toriyama since he came up actually drew a picture of a Yumi Hamasaki as Goku for an album that was coming out.

496
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:36,383
Scott: Oh, really?

497
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:37,426
Rym: It's kind of cool.

498
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,710
Rym: So here's a picture of it.

499
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,332
Rym: You can look at it.

500
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:46,049
Rym: It basically just looks like a Yumi Hamasaki in her current form Dressed up as Son Goku.

501
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:51,110
Rym: You know, I say her current form because she is basically a transformer.

502
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:54,402
Scott: Yeah, you know Jeff Lemire did an album cover for somebody really?

503
00:31:54,503 --> 00:31:55,265
Scott: Yeah, huh?

504
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:55,848
Rym: It looks pretty.

505
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:56,430
Scott: it looks pretty cool.

506
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:57,899
Rym: I should do an album cover for someone.

507
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,389
Scott: Yeah, you need to get on that.

508
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,738
Scott: So, I don't know is it a week or two ago?

509
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:12,118
Scott: I forget right I took an episode was it a Tuesday episode To educate the punk kids about The day the music died?

510
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:12,420
Scott: right?

511
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:13,023
Scott: and I don't.

512
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,330
Scott: I don't think it was a Wednesday.

513
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:19,470
Scott: So I have to re-educate on Wednesday for people who did not listen to the other show, right?

514
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:27,910
Scott: basically, you know imagine if you know Elvis the Beatles and you know Led Zeppelin were in a plane crash and they died.

515
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:31,360
Scott: Well, you know how different would the world be today?

516
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,427
Scott: crazy different super crazy different.

517
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:44,950
Scott: Well Back in the day 50 years ago a Plane did crash with three musicians of that caliber on it and the world is crazy different from how it should be.

518
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:55,906
Rym: And the three musicians were Buddy Holly Richie Valens and the Big Bopper, you know If you don't understand why the world is different Bill and Ted's excellent adventure can really clear that up for you.

519
00:32:56,086 --> 00:33:07,813
Scott: Oh, yeah, actually, yeah absolutely So To do a thing of the day to help educate the punk Wednesday kids to talk slowly because you're trying to think of what you're Actually gonna say.

520
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:08,657
Scott: no, I know exactly.

521
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:13,436
Scott: I'm gonna say I have here an anime music video To one of the Big Boppers.

522
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:25,270
Scott: Well, in fact the Big Boppers most popular song ever Oh and it is also one of the best music videos of anime Ever is a classic and it has never been a thing of the day.

523
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:26,810
Rym: It has never been a thing of the day.

524
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,779
Rym: I've thought about using it as a cop-out thing of the day.

525
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,318
Scott: Well, I'm using it as a non cop-out thing of the day Right now.

526
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,196
Rym: well played Yes.

527
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:38,781
Scott: Yes, indeed.

00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:42,262
Scott: I Needed to come up with and you know, this is this really is.

529
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:47,759
Scott: it's one of the best music videos ever one of the greatest songs Not much else.

530
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:48,303
Rym: we can say.

531
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:53,229
Scott: yeah great anime You should check it all out.

532
00:33:54,711 --> 00:34:03,950
Rym: So recently we were treated with a screening in a theater of an anime movie Which is a rare enough event to where we pretty much can't pass that up.

533
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,245
Scott: Well, I mean, you know whenever they happen we see them.

534
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:08,230
Scott: That's pretty much.

535
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,571
Scott: I think.

536
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:12,969
Scott: I've seen every anime that was in theaters for the past like five years.

537
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,947
Rym: Yeah I mean I remember I saw Innocence in theaters and then it's been just about almost everything since that.

538
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:20,783
Rym: I missed Tekkonkinkreet which I'm sad about but that was my.

539
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:21,989
Scott: oh, yeah, I didn't see that one.

540
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,416
Rym: Yeah, that was entirely my fault.

541
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,786
Scott: But I saw I saw innocence.

542
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:31,202
Scott: I saw Miyazaki movies going back to spirited away.

543
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:31,503
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,330
Scott: I just remembered RIT anime.

545
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:37,693
Rym: We rented out the local actual movie theater to show Spirited away.

546
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:38,815
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

547
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:46,976
Rym: Yeah good times, but we were able to see a brand new anime movie Sword of the stranger.

548
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:49,364
Scott: it's not that brand new isn't it actually from o7?

549
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:55,342
Rym: it is from o7 late o7 But it's as brand new as movies like that are for people like us.

550
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:57,490
Scott: and yeah, it's effectively brand new in the u.s.

551
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,010
Scott: I mean, I don't remember ever seeing fan subs of it, even though they may have existed.

552
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,901
Scott: I don't remember seeing you know bit Torrance or being.

553
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:07,810
Scott: I don't remember seeing it in theaters before and there's no DVD of it.

554
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,050
Rym: I honestly did not know this existed until they announced the American release me either.

555
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:17,240
Rym: But sort of the stranger is uh We're gonna review it.

556
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,683
Rym: Don't worry.

557
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:18,750
Rym: No spoilers here at all.

558
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:27,826
Rym: We're not gonna talk about it super long because there are few enough anime full-length motion pictures that are out there let alone that are good and that are new.

559
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:39,030
Rym: also that I Could not in good conscience spoil one because if you're an anime fan You should seek out pretty much every anime movie that comes out in America like without question.

560
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,962
Scott: Yep, even if it's well except Pokemon, you don't to watch the Pokemon.

561
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:43,845

00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:45,410
Rym: Snorlax is more ripped than you.

563
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,439
Scott: That's that's like the first Pokemon movie.

564
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:52,166
Scott: You don't need to watch like, you know, the other ones I mean, they're on like Pokemon movie like 20, right?

565
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,372
Rym: You can't see 20.

566
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:57,423
Scott: You don't need to watch like all that hundred and one-piece movies either.

567
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:58,547
Rym: Oh my god.

568
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:01,719
Rym: Yeah true I'll give you that well played.

569
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,435
Rym: Yeah, but sword of the stranger Directed by now this.

570
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:14,580
Rym: usually we talk about the director, but I honestly didn't know anything about endo and I You didn't do a lot that I have a lot to say about.

571
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,089
Rym: so I'm afraid I don't have much to say.

572
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:19,597
Rym: I could do A bunch of research and pretend I had something to say.

573
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:23,650
Scott: no, but the key thing here is studio bones did this movie?

574
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:30,199
Rym: Yes, now you might if you don't know who bones is up cowboy bebop Eska flown.

575
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,637
Scott: Hey Um, what's the other one?

576
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:39,933
Scott: didn't they do FMA - maybe they did a Wolves rain.

577
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:40,675
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:41,116
Rym: Yeah.

579
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:41,858
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,806
Rym: So of course this movie looks amazing.

581
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:46,210
Rym: It's done amazingly.

582
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,874
Rym: It's got a lot of.

583
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,904
Rym: it's got a lot of talent behind it.

584
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:49,870
Rym: It's a big movie.

585
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,897
Rym: It looks like it was high-budget really well animated and relatively high-budget Compared to movies I have seen.

586
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:56,779
Scott: Oh, yeah.

587
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,040
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:08,598
Scott: I mean this wasn't like a major like, you know It didn't have as high a budget as like the sky crawlers or anything, you know, which had plenty of you know Big-time monies, but it had a bigger budget.

589
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:16,041
Rym: didn't say I don't know a one-piece movie But sword of the stranger is pretty much.

590
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:21,635
Rym: I'm not gonna say it's a throwback and I'm not gonna say it's an homage necessarily, but it is definitely.

591
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:33,510
Rym: if you like an old like samurai in Japan kind of movie either live-action or anime This is like already gonna be one of your favorite movies.

592
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:39,770
Scott: It didn't feel to me like they were doing an homage or a throwback or anything nostalgic or anything like that.

593
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:54,187
Scott: It felt to me like they were just making a movie in a well-traveled genre instead of you know People trying to you know avoid Well-traveled genres or you know do something new or do a combining genres or a twist.

594
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:57,181
Scott: They just sort of said hey Let's make a samurai movie.

595
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,589
Scott: All right, sure and they did.

596
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:06,149
Rym: Yep, and I think the reason why I mean I feel like a lot of people will look at it and think at first impression This is homage or something like that.

597
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:16,763
Rym: but really I think a lot of the feelings I had like that were due to nostalgia for Anime like this that I just haven't seen in a long time.

598
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:20,592
Rym: It's it was a fun engaging Interesting.

599
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,259
Rym: It wasn't like a great movie.

600
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,705
Rym: This was no Citizen Kane here.

601
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:24,950
Rym: There was no cowboy bebop.

602
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:29,150
Scott: Yeah, this isn't like this isn't a movie that's gonna you know, knock you off your feet and go.

603
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:38,892
Scott: Oh, man That was like a movie for the age is gonna be remembered forever in greatness and greatness and it's not going to tell give you any particularly profound Feelings.

604
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:39,354
Rym: It doesn't.

605
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:45,167
Scott: Yeah, it's not exactly the most intellectual It's it's people cutting each other up.

606
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:45,852
Scott: But

607
00:38:46,353 --> 00:39:02,255
Rym: it was something I guess maybe because the last anime movie the last two anime movies I saw Were the new Miyazaki film which is fantastic but it's it's deeper and there's more to it than this and sky crawlers, which is a very

608
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:02,899
Scott: heady,

609
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,515
Rym: yes, uh Oshi tacular movie.

610
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:07,899
Scott: Oh, she's a glad.

611
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,302
Scott: I think it's oh she tastic.

612
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:11,147
Rym: No because it's shero tastic.

613
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:17,204
Rym: It's oh she tacular Because oh she does not TASM all over you when you watch this film.

614
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:17,625
Rym: I don't know.

615
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,030
Scott: Maybe it's just oh, she awesome.

616
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,159
Rym: I mean Shiro basically.

617
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,461
Scott: Oh sheet.

618
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:36,940
Rym: Oh But shero basically it's kind of like Wagner if you go to a Wagner opera Wagner basically rises from the dead comes out on stage and Ejaculates all over the audience for like seven hours.

619
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:38,486
Scott: I don't know.

620
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:39,550
Scott: Does he have that much in him?

621
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,694
Rym: Are you kidding?

622
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,610
Rym: Have you seen any of his opera?

623
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,360
Scott: Haven't seen his?

624
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:49,210
Rym: Shiro Manga are like that only with Shiro TASM.

625
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:54,626
Rym: Shiro TASM's all over you right, but oh she doesn't really get it all over you.

626
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:59,290
Rym: he kind of puts it there and You have to kind of go and get it from him.

627
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:07,402
Rym: Like if you go up to him and say oh she I see you made a movie I would like you to fill my mind with things that I barely Understand and make me feel kind of bad about myself by the end.

628
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:11,395
Rym: He will fulfill that All right, so but he won't.

629
00:40:11,435 --> 00:40:12,359
Rym: you won't get it all over.

630
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:15,590
Scott: So sort of a stranger is the samurai movie.

631
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:24,050
Scott: It's in Japan, there's a kid and his dog and they meet a samurai And he's dangerous.

632
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,417
Rym: Two strangers come.

633
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:27,080
Scott: you know what it is.

634
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,170
Scott: Well, it's got the buddy movie aspect, right?

635
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,821
Scott: They don't get along but they stick together sort of like samurai Champloo, right?

636
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,326
Scott: It's like why are we together?

637
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:35,530
Scott: Okay, we stay together.

638
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:36,653
Scott: Why are we together?

639
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:37,135
Scott: I hate you.

640
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:37,496
Scott: No.

641
00:40:37,777 --> 00:40:38,158
Scott: Oh shit.

642
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:39,000
Scott: I'm unprotected.

643
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,270
Scott: Yeah, we really should protect her right, you know that sort of situation.

644
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:44,867
Rym: In general the movie really like.

645
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:47,795
Scott: Yeah, like we hate each other We really like each other.

646
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:57,130
Rym: the story the characters like all the basics of this movie from the buddy part on are they feel at first really predictable and trite like you look and you're like.

647
00:40:57,712 --> 00:41:08,437
Rym: It's obvious what's gonna happen and the movie follows up like a very expected format But at the same time it pulls an eska flown a in that Eska flown a was just a magical girl.

648
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:09,861
Rym: fantasy move like show like it.

649
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:23,820
Rym: that was it but it was so well executed that any feelings that the genre had been played out or any feelings that it was just rehashing or it was predictable were Completely destroyed by the fact that it was executed.

650
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,550
Rym: probably as well as that genre can be executed.

651
00:41:26,871 --> 00:41:30,284
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I feel like a lot of shows and books.

652
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:33,015
Scott: and then you know just genre Storytelling.

653
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:39,559
Scott: these days all across the board people are trying to you know Do things different and people sort of.

654
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:49,490
Scott: it feels like people have forgotten how to just you know Pick a genre and just tell that kind of story even though that kind of story has been told a million times.

655
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:52,790
Scott: Tell another one and just do it really well.

656
00:41:52,931 --> 00:42:04,030
Scott: And I mean if you just tell you know I mean there's a reason people have been enjoying samurai stories for many years The reason people have enjoyed, you know adventure stories for many years or buddy stories.

657
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:13,830
Rym: There's a reason why they're good why your Jimbo was turned into fistful of dollars, which was turned into cause I know your Jimbo million other movies that are basically the exact same movie.

658
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,830
Scott: Yeah, I mean cuz it's a good kind of story that works.

659
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:28,410
Scott: so there is a lot to be said for just taking a story a kind of story that has been told a million times before and Telling a new story that fits right in line with the old stories.

660
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:30,149
Scott: But it's just well done.

661
00:42:30,835 --> 00:42:39,170
Rym: but this movie Departs from that a little bit in that it tells the old classic story in the classic style and it's really well executed.

662
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:52,126
Rym: But there are I'd say like 15 moments not really like the plot kind of goes along the way you expect and I'm not gonna talk about the end because While the end is able to be seen coming in some ways.

663
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,050
Rym: It's not in other ways.

664
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,596
Rym: And again, I don't want to risk spoiling anything.

665
00:42:54,636 --> 00:43:13,969
Rym: But the rest of the movie will it will periodically you expect something because you know what this genre is, you know how these movies go and then something just Completely different and crazy and sudden happens instead Like a character that you expect a certain thing to happen with just like fucking gets killed like that.

666
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:17,550
Scott: Yeah, there are actually a bunch of characters in the movie, right?

667
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:17,711
Scott: And I

668
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:18,115
Rym: don't know

669
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:40,049
Scott: it felt like, you know Sometimes you watch like a like a summary movie right for something Like a TV show and there's a summary movie that the summary movie will have Characters that were somewhat important in the TV show like side characters and they'll sort of be they'll sort of stand out in the summary Movie, but they won't get a lot of screen time.

670
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,661
Scott: So it's sort of like they're sort of like huh?

671
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:43,324
Scott: What's up with that?

672
00:43:43,364 --> 00:43:44,670
Scott: and it feels kind of weird, right?

673
00:43:45,230 --> 00:44:12,570
Scott: This movie had some of that where there would be a character who obviously was designed, you know They didn't have a name necessarily or maybe they did But they had a design as an important character would have you know, not just a background character, right and Maybe they would get a little bit of screen time a little bit of prominent screen presence for short moments Even though they weren't really involved in the plot very much or anything like that.

674
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,550
Scott: You know, they didn't really hinge anything on these characters.

675
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:20,890
Scott: But you know then in some fight or other the character would die or they would kill someone or something would happen.

676
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:30,890
Scott: It's like, you know, wow that they put in like this whole character designed them Significantly and then they were sort of actually, you know, they didn't even really need to be there.

677
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:36,850
Scott: That could have just been a background, you know, looks like everyone else character and I gotta say when that is done.

678
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:51,418
Rym: Well, I like I really enjoy movies where all the characters like where the character that is just a bit character Even if it doesn't all come out on the screen if the character is themselves a strong character for what little part they play it's like a lot of.

679
00:44:51,538 --> 00:45:03,141
Rym: it's very easy to make movies and films where You have your set of main characters and everyone else is just a background character, but like in sort of the samurai Every single person on the screen has character.

680
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:12,190
Rym: like when there's a bunch of soldiers lined up when there's a big thing going on near The end like all their faces are different and when when something happens, it's kind of an epic scene what happens?

681
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:22,810
Rym: It is definitely one of those Oh Moments when when someone gets put up on that pole and then someone goes well, it's time and does something Yeah, I think that was a good scene.

682
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:33,670
Rym: But you see all these soldiers reacting to this event and they all react differently Like they took the time to make every soldier be a little bit unique and react in a little bit of a unique way.

683
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,890
Scott: Well, not every single soul.

684
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:46,570
Rym: No, not like like you look and you see like a bunch of soldiers reacting in a positive way But a bunch of other ones mixed out kind of balking and then a couple like ready to go in the opposite way But then kind of stopping way.

685
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:46,994
Scott: It's like.

686
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:55,228
Scott: it's not just like, you know The leader of the army and then his you know, just my followers to do exactly what he does, you know And they don't even have faces.

687
00:45:55,432 --> 00:45:57,395
Scott: It's like, you know His his like head.

688
00:45:57,476 --> 00:46:03,703
Scott: few guys actually have a little bit of character to them Even though you don't really know their names or anything and you know, they have.

689
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:13,710
Scott: you know the distinctive, you know designs Like obviously someone designed them as if they were a character with a name And then they sort of act on their own a little bit even though the screen time is short.

690
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:14,131
Scott: And

691
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:28,010
Rym: that's also I think what gave this movie the ability to have all these kind of Oh Snap moments that kind of pull you out of the genre and make you go Oh, wow And like you forget what kind of movie you're watching and just get drawn into the moment of they totally just killed that guy.

692
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:33,228
Rym: Wow, or or try not to spoil anything because there's a couple of really good ones there.

693
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:47,445
Rym: Yeah There's quite a few good ones there and there are some scenes where in particular one guy dies at one point and the way he dies is So reminiscent of the scene in snatch where someone else dies.

694
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:51,999
Scott: Yeah Now a few things I got to say right.

695
00:46:52,039 --> 00:47:01,410
Scott: first of all one thing that bothered me and this isn't the movie's fault Right, but in the theater we watched it in they there was almost definitely something wrong with the projector.

696
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,958
Rym: Clearly the bulb was like burning out and they didn't replace it.

697
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,663
Scott: Yeah, and we watched it.

698
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:06,405
Scott: Basically.

699
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:08,130
Scott: It was a digital projector.

700
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:12,770
Scott: So basically it was just like watching, you know a DVD on a giant screen, right?

701
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,550
Rym: Yeah, we definitely have to watch this movie again in a better form.

702
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:22,962
Scott: Yeah, because like there were scenes, you know most scenes you could see everything that was going on But there were some were like, you know, it was.

703
00:47:23,163 --> 00:47:24,330
Scott: it was just dark, right?

704
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:34,150
Scott: It's like I remember one scene in particular like someone drops a dark object Onto the floor in a dark room and then it sort of rolls around and it's like you can hear it rolling.

705
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,372
Scott: But I couldn't see it rolling because there wasn't enough contrast because the bulb and the projector was dying Right.

706
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:40,901
Rym: Well, it doesn't really.

707
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:42,370
Rym: it's not relevant to our review at all.

708
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,106
Scott: So no, no, no.

709
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,191
Scott: But you know, it just it sort of bothered me a little bit and it was sort of in my mind while I was watching It.

710
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:48,572
Scott: whatever.

711
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,199
Scott: but also we watched the dub.

712
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,924
Scott: There was no subtitle version.

713
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:53,024
Scott: Yes.

714
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:54,970
Rym: Let's review the dub at the end.

715
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,093
Scott: All right, I want to.

716
00:47:56,113 --> 00:48:05,610
Rym: I want to say I don't want dub review to uh get on or in my movie review Because you kind of got to review them separately because the movie itself stands on its own.

717
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:06,524
Scott: All right.

718
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:07,814
Scott: Well It is.

719
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,530
Scott: Oh, what else should we say about the movie?

720
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:14,255
Rym: Well, I had a lot to say, all right All right, so you're done.

721
00:48:14,295 --> 00:48:14,798
Rym: You got nothing.

722
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:15,902
Scott: I don't know.

723
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:17,710
Scott: I mean, you know, it's a samurai movie.

724
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:18,995
Scott: I don't want to spoil it.

725
00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:23,150
Scott: We you know, how many times we got to say that, you know, there's a it's a buddy movie.

726
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:23,930
Scott: It's fun.

727
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,819
Scott: Yeah, that's I think that's really what it is.

728
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,964
Scott: It's just fun.

729
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:29,374
Scott: You know, it's not Anything epic.

730
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:32,385
Scott: It's just you go in you watch this you have a lot of fun.

731
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:33,148
Scott: for how long is it?

732
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:33,429
Scott: 90 minutes?

733
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,678
Rym: Well, i'll put it this way.

734
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:46,630
Rym: This isn't a spoiler but the movie is is a movie where you start with a small plot that grows into a bigger plot and Clearly there is a large epic plot building toward the end that involves the world.

735
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:53,182
Rym: But the way it happens is that half of that big plot Doesn't happen through the movie.

736
00:48:53,202 --> 00:49:02,803
Rym: like you see things in the movie that allude to the future of japan like the rise of shoguns and all the the beginning of a long era of political turmoil in japan.

737
00:49:03,305 --> 00:49:10,227
Rym: and there's a lot of kind of Set up for the real world history of japan in the movie which adds a lot and is interesting.

738
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:20,225
Rym: and two The one thing that they do is that the big epic plot Has mystical trappings, but the movie is straight up real world.

739
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:20,987
Rym: No magic.

740
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:22,171
Rym: None of that bs at all Really?

741
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:25,401
Scott: Well, there is a little bit of science fiction going on.

742
00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:27,829
Scott: Well, very little yeah, but it's it's.

743
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:31,426
Scott: yeah I think it's sort of it sort of fits and actually it's hard to notice.

744
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:34,484
Scott: if you don't pay attention You might be like what the fuck but it's actually.

745
00:49:34,544 --> 00:49:40,710
Scott: it's pretty important But it's you know, if you don't pay attention, you're not gonna you're not gonna realize what the deal is.

746
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,500
Rym: I guess the movie is is there is depth here to where.

747
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:50,303
Rym: while this is just a fun movie and you can just enjoy it Just we You should pay attention to because it does have some things to say and it does.

748
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:56,130
Rym: there's a lot of allusion to history And there's a lot of really good just background and atmosphere.

749
00:49:56,251 --> 00:50:00,268
Scott: it's also a lot of allusion to like, you know, it's almost like there was.

750
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:04,190
Scott: uh, Like you're expecting it to go in a certain direction.

751
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:13,300
Scott: But really instead of it going in that direction, they just leave something unexplained like, you know, it's like hey That seems like that could have been caused by time travel.

752
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,246
Scott: Are they going to explain time travel later?

753
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:18,929
Scott: And they just never do You know and they just leave it at that.

754
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:20,334
Scott: It's like huh?

755
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:26,474
Scott: Well, I wonder how that was then and they just don't because it's not relevant to the the one story You're paying attention to.

756
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:30,390
Scott: so it's almost as if like you're watching this story unfold, right?

757
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:34,125
Scott: And you're getting these side bits from other stories, but those aren't.

758
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:35,410
Scott: the story you're watching unfolds.

759
00:50:35,591 --> 00:50:42,090
Scott: All you get is the side bits from them and it sort of hinted that there may be things that happen in those side stories.

760
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:47,910
Scott: You know these other characters or something that are you know crazy or might be worthy of stories.

761
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:50,848
Scott: You know a whole movie on their own, but they don't tell them to you.

762
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:58,965
Scott: So you're just sort of you know left with these hints in the feeling Of you know a larger movie than what you're actually getting.

763
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:06,070
Rym: but at the same time The movie does not disappoint in that it doesn't just turn into the big epic magic thing at the end.

764
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:07,077
Rym: No, it doesn't.

765
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,839
Rym: is very much one of those Real world mundane endings.

766
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:14,690
Scott: Yeah, I was kind of hoping for a robot at the end, but it didn't happen.

767
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,090
Rym: Well, that's the thing because you know The.

768
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,422
Rym: the basic plot is that there's this boy and the movie begins.

769
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:22,818
Rym: he's running away from a burning temple and a monk is like Smuggling him out.

770
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:23,664
Rym: He runs away on his own.

771
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:24,369
Rym: He's got this dog.

772
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:26,858
Rym: The dog is so cute and well animated.

773
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:28,524
Scott: by the way, the dog is badass.

774
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,210
Scott: the dog is not so cute.

775
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,289
Rym: The dog is cute and badass.

776
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:40,703
Rym: Also, the main character kid is also like really funny and cute like, you know There's actually a lot of humor going on in this movie.

777
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:51,538
Rym: there is but it's really kind of I don't want to say slice of life But it's it's humor that is contextual kind of like when music like background music in a movie Is contextual as opposed to like.

778
00:51:51,859 --> 00:52:00,269
Rym: it's like the difference between a movie that makes a joke That is for the benefit of the viewer versus a movie where a character makes a joke for the benefit of another character.

779
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:07,230
Rym: There's no like external humor unless you're the kind of person who's going to crack up when a guy gets shot with a thousand arrows.

780
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,459
Scott: Oh, man, that was pretty fun.

781
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:09,044
Rym: It was like that.

782
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:25,230
Rym: But like all the humor is humor between characters which makes it feel a lot more real because Sometimes it's lame humor But it's lame in this real way and the characters are really fleshed out and really complex and really three-dimensional.

783
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:34,045
Scott: speaking of getting shot with a thousand arrows, right the movie has You know, like usually a samurai movie will have like lots of gore.

784
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:35,750
Scott: I mean look at even like a kenshin, right?

785
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,890
Scott: You know, it's got like all blood all over the place talking about the oav not the tv show, right?

786
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:47,212
Scott: You know and this had you know some level of gore type stuff going on, but it wasn't Like.

787
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:50,893
Scott: it wasn't like each of the killer or anything, you know The gore was.

788
00:52:51,073 --> 00:53:00,087
Rym: it wasn't few and far between and when it happened it was kind of it was there to Impress upon you that yes, people are dying and this sucks.

789
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:10,455
Scott: Yeah It's like it wasn't you know, extremely gory for the sake of gore's sake but it wasn't toned down gore for the sake of Not grossing you out sake.

790
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,161
Scott: it was like a guy got cut.

791
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:12,743
Scott: look.

792
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:14,710
Scott: Oh, we're gonna draw a guy who got cut.

793
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,316
Rym: That's what happens when you get cut.

794
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:22,316
Scott: Yep, and you know, so some of the parts were a little bit, you know Ew, but they weren't crazy.

795
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:29,560
Scott: Ew, you know, it was sort of like, you know, just right and the you know cutting didn't happen That often that you were just.

796
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:32,131
Scott: you know, it was just blood all over the place, you know It.

797
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:43,724
Scott: just in the fighting scenes there was blood and in the fighting scenes the action was sort of done in a in a somewhat interesting way where All the action was really fast and there was.

798
00:53:43,864 --> 00:53:52,550
Scott: it was lots of you know Sort of blurry motion effects going on and you know They kept giving you like a bunch of different crazy camera angles during all the action scenes.

799
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:59,730
Rym: It depends because it alternated between the shaky cam, you know Zoom in zoom out like like a real person trying to watch what's going on and cutting to the angles.

800
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:07,588
Rym: But it would also cut to long shots of very like well choreographed bits of the fight.

801
00:54:08,252 --> 00:54:16,427
Scott: Yeah, you know sometimes it was you know a little bit hard to to follow, you know Like every single move in the fight like, you know a punch and a kick and a slash.

802
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:17,952
Rym: I don't know.

803
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:19,436
Rym: I didn't really have that problem like to me.

804
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:30,306
Rym: I felt like the fights were Either they were choreographed in 3d completely and then they figured out what angles they wanted and they put it all together Or it was so well done that I feel that way.

805
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:31,090
Rym: I don't know.

806
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:36,646
Scott: I you know when I during the fight scenes, I just sort of felt like you know Ha fight fight fight fight fight fight.

807
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:44,415
Scott: I couldn't really you know, like follow the fight so much until I really Except for when someone actually got hit then it was like, oh so hosons.

808
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:44,817
Scott: I got hit.

809
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:55,100
Rym: All right I disagree at least halfway and then I feel like a good half of the fight scenes were Choreographed and very direct and I felt like I felt very in the action.

810
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:57,320
Scott: I didn't feel that much in the action.

811
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:10,440
Scott: It just sort of felt like, you know action action action action, but not following it, you know, like, you know Like there was any sort of flow to the fight or I you know could like be like, you know I wasn't feeling like, you know for one side or the other.

812
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,611
Rym: All I can say is that I pretty much completely disagree with you on that point.

813
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:20,160
Scott: Nah, you know, you know, I do I mean, I didn't say he does but I you know, i'm just saying I know what you're saying.

814
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:32,880
Scott: I just I watch like the fights in cowboy bebop and it's like oh, yeah, you know It's you know, like he ducks and then he dives to the side and then he kicks over the table Right, so yeah that one fight there weren't that many fights like that.

815
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,592
Scott: No, but there you know, there there weren't that many fights.

816
00:55:35,672 --> 00:55:44,460
Rym: really if you watch cowboy bebop again Yeah, but there are a lot of fights in this and enough of them were Similar to that or had at least one or two long shots within them.

817
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:50,180
Scott: I think that the the fights I think what it was that the fights didn't have lots of punctuation in them.

818
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,119
Scott: They were just sort of like these flows.

819
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:54,297
Rym: So you just said they didn't have any flow.

820
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:56,063
Scott: No, they was just.

821
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,387
Scott: it was just you know a smooth.

822
00:55:57,848 --> 00:56:01,580
Rym: i'm basically because I feel that your criticism is unwarranted.

823
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:05,442
Rym: I I really want you to back it up because I don't see it I.

824
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:09,357
Scott: the fights were just you know, just like a smooth blur and so they were smooth.

825
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:10,040
Rym: so they had flow.

826
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:13,960
Scott: You know, these are all subjective terms.

827
00:56:14,702 --> 00:56:18,452
Rym: But you said both that the fights had flow and that they didn't have.

828
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:21,180
Scott: well even at this I wasn't feeling the fights.

829
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:26,230
Scott: I mean I could see that they were going for an interesting style in the fight But I they didn't feel.

830
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,840
Scott: you know that exciting.

831
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,080
Scott: It just felt like you know a blur of action.

832
00:56:31,461 --> 00:56:32,284
Scott: That was not you.

833
00:56:32,364 --> 00:56:36,377
Scott: you couldn't really follow it and then you only went like at the end you saw.

834
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:37,360
Scott: Oh that guy won.

835
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,840
Rym: I'm gonna go the opposite and say that I was.

836
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:43,040
Rym: I really felt like I was in the fights and I felt every moment of them.

837
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:51,779
Scott: I I would prefer a different kind of fight, but I see that they were going for something that you know I haven't seen anywhere else, but I guess I just I still disagree.

838
00:56:52,462 --> 00:56:55,936
Rym: Now you can disagree all you want, okay, we'll have to let the listeners watch it and see.

839
00:56:55,956 --> 00:56:58,979
Rym: yeah But this movie is it.

840
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:02,380
Rym: There are so many points where the main character is doing stuff.

841
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,719
Rym: Well, they got the samurai guy no name and all I can think is i'm too old for this shit.

842
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:13,740
Rym: This definitely was like a cross between an i'm too old for this shit movie and a samurai movie.

843
00:57:15,343 --> 00:57:22,600
Rym: Yeah, yeah because it was while it was a buddy movie It had a lot of i'm too old for this shit buddy movie as opposed to other kinds of buddy movie.

844
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:26,559
Scott: Yeah, the other kinds of buddy movies are like, you know, they're not too old for it.

845
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,620
Scott: They're just sort of reluctant to be with the other person.

846
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Scott: It's like they would be doing it on their own if they weren't with the other person.

847
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:36,960
Scott: But this is like if I wasn't with this other person I wouldn't be doing this at all.

848
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:38,532
Scott: Yeah, i'd be sitting at home going.

849
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:44,751
Scott: Ah Plus I gotta say They're not only they're not only reluctant to be together.

850
00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:46,840
Scott: They're reluctant to even be doing anything.

851
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:53,140
Rym: uh in the I mean We gotta wrap this up because it's late and i'm tired and we got people coming over and we got a crazy weekend coming up.

852
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,091
Rym: But suffice to say i'm gonna keep saying that those words tonight.

853
00:57:56,252 --> 00:57:56,794
Scott: Stop saying.

854
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:57,437
Scott: suffice to say.

855
00:57:57,457 --> 00:57:58,139
Rym: suffice to say.

856
00:57:58,701 --> 00:57:59,384
Scott: This is plus.

857
00:57:59,444 --> 00:58:01,231
Scott: the other thing is you keep saying suffice to say.

858
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:02,255
Scott: you're supposed to say.

859
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,419
Scott: suffice it to say.

860
00:58:04,363 --> 00:58:05,578
Scott: Uh, you're leaving out the it.

861
00:58:06,342 --> 00:58:07,427
Rym: Uh suffice to say.

862
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,359
Rym: however, I believe can work grammatically and i'll back that up.

863
00:58:12,603 --> 00:58:13,914
Scott: What are you sufficing to say?

864
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:15,663
Scott: because the implies Suffice it.

865
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:18,232
Rym: you realize that the implied sentence is.

866
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:20,278
Rym: it would suffice to say that.

867
00:58:21,383 --> 00:58:22,467
Rym: Yeah, what i'm saying?

868
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:29,340
Rym: Well, you're leaving out an it so you've got no subject But implied grammar is perfectly okay in a lot of situations in english.

869
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,804
Rym: Yes, you can have implied subjects.

870
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:33,589
Rym: In fact in imperative sentences.

871
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:38,604
Rym: I mean go is a perfectly valid sentence because man though No, it's it.

872
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:39,448
Rym: Yes scott.

873
00:58:39,468 --> 00:58:40,815
Rym: That's what the word imperative means.

874
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:41,880
Rym: It's an imperative sentence.
