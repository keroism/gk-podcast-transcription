1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,048
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 29th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:16,939
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight, 6 Nymphs.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,718
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,350
Rym: So as you all know, we were at Anime Boston.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,327
Rym: Those of you who might have found us because of Anime Boston, Hey, this is GeekNights Tuesday.

6
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,400
Rym: We're going to talk about games and stuff, not so much the anime.

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,569
Rym: But, on the way home, Scott and I were bored.

8
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,580
Rym: You know, it was going to be a long bus ride and we didn't even go to the con on Sunday.

9
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:42,060
Rym: So we sat down and I asked the question I always ask whenever me and Scott are alone together.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,979
Scott: You want to play Advance Wars?

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Rym: It's either you want to play Advance Wars or you want to play Civ 5.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,415
Rym: And for the first time in my life, that clock rang and Scott said, "You know what?

13
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:53,418
Rym: Yeah.".

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,540
Scott: I figured it would make the bus ride go much faster.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,207
Rym: And it did, actually.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,780
Rym: We played Civ 5 Hot Seat, which I've never done.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,999
Scott: We should have done it with two laptops and played two games.

18
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:04,325
Rym: Uh, yeah.

19
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:07,740
Rym: That would have been perfect, except I'm the only one of us who had a laptop that could play Civ 5.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,113
Scott: Why don't they make--my iPad Pro is better than your laptop.

21
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,320
Scott: Why don't they make Civ 5 for it?

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,942
Rym: I don't know.

23
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:21,280
Rym: That's actually the one--the only reason I'm leery of the iPad is, as much as I want one, I like to play games like Rocket League and Civ 5 on my laptop when I travel.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,558
Scott: Oh, you can just play different games.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,302
Rym: Like what?

26
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:27,380
Rym: What game is as good as Civ 5 or Rocket League or Counter Strike that you can play on the iPad?

27
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,039
Scott: Hearthstone.

28
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,260
Scott: Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,459
Scott: Hearthstone is the best iPad game you can play.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,560
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,331
Scott: That's the reason--that's the only reason I play it.

32
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:35,559
Scott: If it were--there was--right?

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,359
Scott: It's like--it's literally the best mobile game that exists.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,436
Rym: But when I'm in, like, Hong Kong or something for a week and I got, you know-- There's mad Hearthstone going on there.

35
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:43,699
Scott: Whoa.

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
Rym: Yeah, but I would rather be playing Rocket League.

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,699
Scott: Well, why don't you just go to, like, a night cafe?

38
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:49,678
Rym: Because I could.

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,680
Scott: And you'd get your ass crushed by some Chinese Rocket League.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Rym: So, I had also never tried the, like, tiny map format, so we just played it dual.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,640
Rym: It was just me and Scott on continent, so we each had a tiny continent.

42
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,559
Rym: And there's four city-states out there.

43
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:06,240
Rym: And we just started going.

44
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:11,019
Rym: And at the end of the bus ride when we got to New York, we'd made it about a hundred turns in.

45
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,660
Rym: And we were just getting to the point where things were getting real interesting.

46
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,880
Scott: The main problem was just, like, I think in the dual map, right?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,140
Scott: It's, like, things that normally can be mitigated.

48
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,980
Scott: It's, like, the game is real different, right?

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,040
Scott: Because you had the guys that have mad boats.

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Scott: Yup.

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,320
Scott: And the map was such that I was on an island and you were on an island.

52
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,039
Scott: My starting city was not on the coast.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,220
Rym: Don't you know the automatic, intrinsic start biases of all the different civilizations?

54
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,580
Scott: I didn't know that that was what the map was going to look like.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,100
Rym: I said continents were probably going to be on two different continents because there's only two of us.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Scott: Right, but I didn't realize that your guy was going to have, like, something that gives you a free million boats.

57
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:45,919
Rym: Yeah, well.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,060
Scott: Like, I figured, like, you know, I didn't, because I don't know all the stupid things in the game.

59
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,020
Scott: There's so many fucking things.

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,919
Scott: I didn't even know that was a thing until you used it.

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,938
Rym: Yeah, I realized that your only problem with Civ V was that you just haven't played it enough, so you don't know stuff.

62
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,197
Rym: Think about how much you know about Civ II.

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,180
Rym: Like, you probably remember what almost every wonder does to this day, even though they don't actually, like, they don't have analogs to modern wonders.

64
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,052
Scott: No, I didn't really know.

65
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:08,697
Scott: I only knew it.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,199
Rym: You knew Leonardo's Workshop, I'll bet, and the pyramids.

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,220
Scott: So, I knew Leonardo's Workshop, and you know why I like Leonardo's Workshop so much?

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,400
Rym: Because you don't have to deal with the upgrades.

69
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:16,999
Scott: Also because it had the best music.

70
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,713
Rym: Yeah, it did.

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,600
Rym: And everyone knew the pyramids, because nobody wanted to build the stupid granary everywhere.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,380
Scott: Yeah, it gives you free granary everywhere.

73
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:27,050
Rym: Yup.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,800
Rym: Though, I've noticed when I play, because I've been playing, you know, not to plug giant multiplayer robot, but I actually paid money now, so I can be in a lot more games.

75
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,280
Rym: I use this thing a lot, and the way it actually works, it's five bucks.

76
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,300
Rym: You just give them five bucks, and you can play up to five games instead of just two forever.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,457
Rym: Just five bucks once.

78
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,760
Rym: I think fifteen bucks is unlimited games forever.

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:04:09,500
Rym: I paid the five bucks, and I got three games going, and I did do my commentary on the big game, but playing the duel against Scott, one thing I realized is that if you have a small empire like that, and you want to rush wonders and rush tradition, you can do like tradition, get some marble early, and just crank out wonders.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:21,158
Scott: That's another thing I didn't realize is I had some marble right fucking there, and I didn't realize what it did until I finally... Until I finally got my worker to work it, and this message pops up, and I'm like, "Oh, that's what Rym's

81
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,620
Scott: doing.".

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,260
Scott: If I would have known that, I would have gotten a worker even earlier and worked it right immediately.

83
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,660
Scott: I did, because I did get the tradition thing immediately, right?

84
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,117
Scott: Yup.

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,179
Scott: I just didn't get the worker on it immediately, because I didn't realize what, you know, I'm just like, "Oh, it's a...".

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,192
Scott: You know, when I see like rocks, I'm like, "Oh, mine the rocks, get production, all right.

87
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:40,516
Scott: I want to get the food first.

88
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,559
Scott: I'll go make a farm

89
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:41,940
Scott: first.".

90
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,020
Rym: I think a lot about those things.

91
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,430
Scott: I don't know all those things.

92
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,860
Scott: There's way too many fucking things.

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,679
Scott: There's not that many.

94
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,360
Scott: There's so many things in this game.

95
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:50,940
Rym: I feel like I know most of them.

96
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,700
Scott: You got culture things, you got sciences, you got buildings, you got wonders, you got units, you got fucking things that you can like get at the councils.

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,760
Scott: There's just so many goddamn things, and great people can do like three different things.

98
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,500
Scott: I can't remember all these fucking things.

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,220
Rym: But Civ 2 had a similar level of bullshit.

100
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,841
Scott: I just didn't know the things when I played Civ 2.

101
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,424
Scott: I just played.

102
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,375
Scott: I never played Civ 2 multiplayer either.

103
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,340
Scott: I played against the computer.

104
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,160
Rym: I always wanted to.

105
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Scott: I never played against it, and I was never able to beat it on like any kind of hard level.

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,138
Scott: I played it normal at the most, and I just sort of played like by feels, just sort of like, "All right, build

107
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:26,419
Scott: stuff.".

108
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:26,847
Rym: Yep.

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,224
Scott: You know, "Oh, there's a wonder.

110
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,329
Scott: I can build it in seven turns.

111
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:29,852
Scott: I'll build it.

112
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:30,816
Scott: I don't know what it does.

113
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:31,379
Scott: I'm just going to build

114
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,439
Scott: it.".

115
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:33,880
Scott: Just building stuff.

116
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:34,800
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,097
Scott: I didn't really even understand like the concepts that like, "Oh, you get food, and then you get

118
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:39,700
Scott: population.".

119
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:40,466
Scott: I didn't know that.

120
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:42,260
Scott: I just like, you just build stuff.

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,745
Rym: You're like, "What are all those red guys?

122
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:44,728
Rym: I guess I'll ignore them.

123
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:46,233
Rym: Hey, why is that guy wearing black?

124
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,738
Rym: Why did my city just revolt?

125
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:48,099
Rym: What's going

126
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,159
Rym: on?".

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,049
Scott: I would just go to cities, and I would click "Produce this next.

128
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,220
Scott: That looks fun," and then click "Next turn," and then move units around, you know.

129
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:54,747
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,954
Scott: I didn't really know what stuff did.

131
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:57,739
Scott: I just like, "Oh," you know.

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,060
Scott: But

133
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:09,819
Rym: I like Civ 5, and I played it a lot because, you know, on long trips, like especially if I'm flying to like East Asia, and I've got like a 12 or 13 hour flight, you can get most of the way through a single player Civ 5 game in a flight like that.

134
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:19,540
Rym: So I would just play like these long games, but pretty bored playing against the AI, and I'm kind of addicted to playing Civ against humans now.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,340
Scott: I can't even beat the AI in anything like above Prince, and if I do Prince, I can only beat it sometimes.

136
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:25,852
Scott: Really?

137
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,629
Scott: And only using like the space shuttle.

138
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:29,500
Scott: Like every time I try something different, it doesn't work.

139
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
Rym: So if I ever go for something different, I kind of accidentally get a domination victory along the way, so it doesn't matter.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,966
Scott: That's the thing, is I can't, like I don't war.

141
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:41,640
Scott: I basically expand with settlers to fill my space, and then I turtle.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,380
Scott: And then I just build stuff.

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,160
Rym: See, this is why I think this duel, so we played that game halfway, and we saved it on my laptop.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Rym: We're going to wait until the bust packs and continue the game.

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,320
Scott: I think we should play a different game, one where you don't have the entire water covered in boats.

146
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,299
Scott: If you- Well, I mean, what hope do I really have?

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,335
Rym: So Scott, that water's covered in boats, but you realize it's just like seven triremes.

148
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,520
Rym: I can't take a city with that.

149
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,679
Scott: Yeah, but I can't move any boats around.

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,699
Rym: Well, you didn't focus on boats.

151
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,780
Scott: But how do I- I need to see the map still and go looking for stuff.

152
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,175
Rym: Yeah, there's one more island that neither one of us got to.

153
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:14,860
Rym: You know what's on it?

154
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,300
Rym: More barbarians than you can imagine, one city-state, two unexplored huts.

155
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,486
Scott: Right, but it's like, even if you take that island, it's like I can't expand my territories or do anything because any boat- Scott, there's nothing else in the whole world.

156
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:30,180
Rym: Unless you conquer something, there's literally nowhere else to settle.

157
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,280
Scott: I still need to see what else is in the world.

158
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:32,527
Scott: Why?

159
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,480
Scott: There's some natural wonders out there.

160
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,400
Rym: I think there's only two natural wonders.

161
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,400
Scott: I haven't seen any of them.

162
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,846
Scott: Really?

163
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:38,660
Rym: There's one on my continent.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what they look like, and then my people would be very happy to see them.

165
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,747
Rym: So here's another thing, because I've noticed this.

166
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,200
Rym: In these games, there are three kinds of civilizations.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,060
Scott: And I can see what your territory looks like and keep an eye on you.

168
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:58,580
Rym: You can't just build one trireme unless you literally only have that trireme to keep barbarians from taking your one or two work boats that are hanging out there.

169
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:03,120
Rym: You either build a fuck ton of boats, or you just don't build boats.

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,468
Scott: See, but that's the thing.

171
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,940
Scott: My starting city was not in the water.

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,640
Rym: Then you gotta be a land civilization.

173
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,240
Scott: Okay, so now I'm trapped in this little island.

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,548
Rym: Yeah, so min-max that island.

175
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,480
Rym: Just build a wall that I can't come in with with artillery and nonsense.

176
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,719
Scott: How am I gonna win the game with that?

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
Rym: I don't know culture.

178
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,179
Scott: I don't think I can win the game with that.

179
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:19,808
Rym: Alright.

180
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,073
Scott: That's what I'm doing, but I don't think it has a chance of winning.

181
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,120
Rym: Well then build a navy and attack me.

182
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,433
Scott: How can I build a navy if you can just plant your navy outside my one city?

183
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,280
Scott: that can build a navy and kill every boat as soon as I build it?

184
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,299
Rym: Put a bunch of catapults or trebuchets or whatever around that city to clear out of space.

185
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,200
Rym: Because you realize, Scott.

186
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
Rym: How can I afford all those?

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,960
Rym: Scott, you don't seem to realize how much of a coward I actually am.

188
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,940
Rym: Like, if my boat comes near you and even an archer attacks it, I just fucking run away.

189
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,100
Scott: I mean, I've already shot a bunch of your boats with archers, but I think that's only helping you not pay for those boats.

190
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Scott: That you have extra boats you don't need.

191
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
Rym: On the Ottomans, I don't pay for those boats anyway.

192
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,140
Rym: Also, I gifted most of those boats to a city state that's allied with me so that they'll declare war on you when I declare war.

193
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,940
Scott: That's another thing, is I mostly need to travel to make trade routes with some cargo ships, right?

194
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,469
Scott: I have a maximum of three trade routes.

195
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,380
Scott: There's only one city state on my island.

196
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,960
Rym: Yeah, there's only one city state on mine.

197
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,340
Scott: So I can trade with one, but you can build cargo boats and they won't get- And I can trade with two and then I'm done.

198
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:21,840
Scott: I'm just saying, is if I could try to get some boats out there, I could trade- Scott, you gotta use the internal routes, the internal caravans.

199
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,055
Scott: Yeah, with what?

200
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:23,460
Scott: Myself?

201
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:23,988
Rym: Yeah.

202
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,080
Scott: All it does is move food from one city to another.

203
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,294
Rym: No, it creates food in production, Scott.

204
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:30,019
Rym: It doesn't move it.

205
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,799
Scott: See, this is why I don't know stuff.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Rym: And if you do an internal route, it's not like minus seven production here, plus seven there.

207
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,420
Rym: It's there just gets plus seven.

208
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,860
Rym: So if you have a crappy little city, you can point like three caravans at it and make it a production powerhouse.

209
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,759
Rym: How do you think people finish wonders so quick?

210
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,753
Scott: I don't know, because they know stuff like that.

211
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:48,400
Scott: that I don't know.

212
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,660
Rym: If you ideology and go communism, right?

213
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,480
Rym: You can do stuff to make those internal routes just be like twice as effective.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,740
Rym: You can just make hammers out of nothing.

215
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,459
Scott: How do I not know this?

216
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,539
Rym: I don't know how you don't know these things.

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,979
Scott: It's too much shit in this game.

218
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,635
Scott: But yeah, so- What other game has a civilopedia and it can't even have an encyclopedia.

219
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:08,840
Scott: It has to have its own media.

220
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,360
Rym: Europa Universalis.

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,375
Scott: Yeah, that's even worse.

222
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,399
Rym: I can't- Yeah, I'm not playing that.

223
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,220
Scott: I can't even play that.

224
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,979
Rym: That's over the line.

225
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:20,720
Scott: See, I can only play Netrunner, which has so many fucking cards, because I started when there were very few cards and I learned the cards one at a time.

226
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,620
Rym: But I guess I'll put it this way.

227
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,279
Scott: And see if I'm starting when there's like three expansions and I gotta learn everything at once.

228
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:30,717
Rym: You just gotta play single player and kind of learn these things.

229
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:31,380
Rym: Try to win.

230
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,399
Scott: I don't have time for this shit.

231
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:32,972
Scott: Alright.

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,340
Rym: But at least what I don't think I found, because I'm in three Civ V games right now, just on GMR.

233
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,400
Rym: And one of them I'm not doing great, because these guys are like super pro.

234
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,880
Rym: But Civ V is real fun, even when you're not winning.

235
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,220
Rym: Because it's still Civ, except unlike against the AI, the diplomacy with the real humans actually matters a lot.

236
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,840
Rym: And if there is a war, it's just awesome advanced wars.

237
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,798
Scott: The problem is that it isn't way fun when you're losing, because the way I lose is I- Slowly peter out.

238
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,740
Scott: No, I don't have a lot of military units and a giant army of a million guys shows up and I'm like, not only how do they build that so fast, but how are they paying for it?

239
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,660
Scott: And then it destroys me in like a few turns.

240
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,549
Rym: You had the same complaint in advanced wars.

241
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,580
Rym: I remember one time we were doing a pretty big map.

242
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:26,740
Rym: And I saw you had this one motorcycle guy and he comes over and he comes over and he gets to these cities in the middle of the map that I had long ago completely captured.

243
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,860
Rym: And I think you accused me of cheating because you couldn't believe I'd gotten people there that fast.

244
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Scott: It's the same thing that's been happening to me in games where you build stuff forever.

245
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,520
Scott: When I played Red Alert back in the day, I sent a group of grenade-y guys to go scout out the enemy base.

246
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:40,440
Rym: And just tanks, tanks, tanks, tanks.

247
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,433
Scott: There's like 30 tanks and meanwhile my war factory is like under construction.

248
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,560
Scott: I'm like, how the fuck did you build that so fast?

249
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,668
Scott: I don't understand, like, what people are doing.

250
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,775
Scott: Because I'm like, build archer.

251
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,719
Scott: Alright, it will take 7 turns.

252
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,755
Scott: And then I look over by you and you get 7 archers and I'm like, there haven't been 49 turns in this game.

253
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,300
Scott: How the fuck did you do that?

254
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,140
Rym: I'm gonna let you in on a tiny secret.

255
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,292
Scott: Everyone cheats but me.

256
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:03,959
Scott: Yes, I know.

257
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,219
Rym: But I'm having a lot of fun with Civ 5 right now and this is like my game between this and Counter-Strike in the last month or two.

258
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:18,140
Rym: And I might start up a fourth or fifth Civ 5 game.

259
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,738
Scott: Do whatever you want to do.

260
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,286
Rym: Yeah.

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,339
Rym: So you got any gaming news?

262
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:23,582
Scott: I do.

263
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:28,980
Scott: So that Nintendo's iOS mobile game, the Miitomo thing.

264
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,940
Scott: It's basically going to be a Mii-related candy box on your phone, pretty much.

265
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:38,780
Scott: It's gonna be out for reals in North America on Thursday.

266
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:39,727
Scott: Yes!

267
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:40,279
Scott: Candy box!

268
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,903
Scott: And it's Tuesday right now.

269
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:46,556
Scott: So everybody, get your candy ready and your insulin ready.

270
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:47,780
Scott: Because it's box time.

271
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,956
Rym: See, I actually did follow through with my threat to not play the 3DS candy box anymore.

272
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:53,658
Rym: I'm done.

273
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:54,340
Rym: I just don't even bother.

274
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,760
Scott: I'm only doing the puzzle piece one and I have every puzzle piece.

275
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,499
Rym: Except there will always be more puzzles.

276
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,860
Scott: They've been coming out much less frequently.

277
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:02,734
Rym: I refuse to.

278
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:03,580
Rym: I'm just done with that.

279
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,980
Rym: Also, I don't even bring my 3DS anywhere because literally no one will play Smash Brothers or Mario Kart with me.

280
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,860
Rym: So it's kind of pointless.

281
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,040
Scott: I will play a different game with you.

282
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,668
Rym: What game?

283
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,159
Rym: Advance Wars?

284
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:16,940
Scott: Uh, candy box.

285
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:23,640
Rym: It is interesting that Nintendo's finally taking these tiny baby steps into mobile.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,350
Rym: But I feel like the long run will be.

287
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,380
Rym: they'll just be a software company on mobile.

288
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,560
Rym: And have some sort of console that maybe also interacts with mobile.

289
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,010
Scott: No, the NX is going to be real.

290
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:35,635
Scott: I feel it.

291
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,380
Scott: The NX is going to be super legit.

292
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,380
Rym: But what form will it take?

293
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,148
Scott: Not the form of those amazing fakes.

294
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,694
Scott: Bravo amazing fake people.

295
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:45,256
Scott: Great job.

296
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,119
Scott: You did the best fake.

297
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,530
Scott: I've seen every fake there is to see.

298
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:50,040
Scott: I've been around as long as the internet.

299
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,259
Scott: And that is the best fake I ever did see.

300
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,014
Rym: The beautiful thing is when the person posted their.

301
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,199
Scott: here's how I faked it.

302
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,080
Scott: If there was internet awards you would get the achievement, the best achievement of the year award.

303
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,659
Rym: But when they posted the here's how I did it, if I'd done it.

304
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,396
Rym: There were replies and comments and discussions about that post claiming that the I faked.

305
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,720
Rym: it post was fake.

306
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,073
Rym: And that's covering up the fact that it's real.

307
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:18,040
Rym: Which is amazing.

308
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,679
Scott: That's how good that fake was.

309
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,340
Scott: Also, it was so believable because the patent wasn't fake.

310
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:24,986
Rym: Which is smart.

311
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:28,880
Rym: You gotta go find a patent like that and base your fake on the patent.

312
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,067
Scott: Now you know what?

313
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:31,709
Scott: It's not a hunt.

314
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:32,231
Scott: You know what?

315
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,480
Scott: Those people were saying it's a cover up.

316
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,232
Scott: I'll give them a tiny percent chance that it actually wasn't fake.

317
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,280
Scott: and they were trying to cover up by saying it was fake.

318
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,979
Rym: The ultimate beauty would be if it was a fake.

319
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,480
Scott: Nintendo did it to test the waters.

320
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,826
Rym: Or what if it was a fake?

321
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:52,060
Rym: but that is actually what the real thing is going to look like mostly.

322
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,798
Scott: So it could be.

323
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,743
Rym: That could happen.

324
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:57,840
Rym: I mean, if there's a couple of smart choices that could be made.

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,420
Rym: There's a lot of smart people in the world so odds are a few smart people would come up with the same solution to a problem.

326
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,120
Rym: In other news, this is actually kind of a big deal.

327
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,640
Rym: So Pax East, I love Pax but it is the worst of the Pax's.

328
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,733
Rym: Now that's like saying this is the worst of the foie gras.

329
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:16,460
Rym: This is the worst of the king's peas.

330
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,620
Scott: This is the least tasty filet mignon.

331
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,318
Rym: But Pax East is the hardest to go to in terms of local logistics because there's like...

332
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,439
Scott: There's no place to eat.

333
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,835
Rym: There's like three hotels within walking distance that are comfortable.

334
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:31,900
Rym: The rest are super far away.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,020
Scott: It's more expensive to go there even though we live in New York very close to Pax East than it is to go to Pax South which is very far away.

336
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,037
Rym: And one of the big problems is...

337
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,160
Scott: Pax Australia is cheaper than Pax East if you live in Australia and Pax Prime is cheaper than Pax East if you live near Pax Prime.

338
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,312
Scott: West.

339
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,019
Scott: They changed the name.

340
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,348
Rym: Which is interesting.

341
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,520
Rym: Don't wait for Pax North.

342
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Rym: There's also rumors of all those tabletop events they might start.

343
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,859
Scott: Well they sent out a survey that was like "How would you like if we had Pax branded tabletop events that were as much smaller than Pax in random

344
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,180
Scott: places?".

345
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,517
Scott: And I was like "I will make it my job to run those and travel around the country doing

346
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:07,698
Scott: that.".

347
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:23,000
Rym: So with Pax Prime and Pax East, but not so much with Pax South, and actually not at all really at least in the ones I went to with Pax Aus, a lot of people just show up Thursday morning and just game in the hotel lobbies like all day and all night.

348
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,020
Scott: That's every Pax ever.

349
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,676
Rym: Pax South there was not nearly as much.

350
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,139
Scott: but... I think we just weren't going to the hotels that had it.

351
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,740
Rym: Well the thing is the hotels were a lot more spread out.

352
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:35,460
Rym: In Pax Prime, the Sheraton is the hotel.

353
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,418
Rym: If you can get into the Sheraton...

354
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,540
Scott: Right, but we go to Pax Prime, even if we're not staying in the Sheraton, we go in the Sheraton.

355
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,660
Scott: At Pax South, I think that Marriott across the street from the convention center is the hotel and we've never even walked inside of it.

356
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:50,440
Scott: I walked in there.

357
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,139
Scott: I never went in it.

358
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,600
Rym: The problem with that hotel is that there's not that much tablespace.

359
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,539
Scott: I haven't been in it.

360
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,898
Rym: There's not a lot of room in there.

361
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,480
Rym: But Pax Prime, the Sheraton, it's a whole convention just going on in that lobby.

362
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,392
Scott: Well, part of the convention is in the Sheraton.

363
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,660
Scott: The real convention is in there.

364
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,640
Scott: There's rooms, panel rooms in there.

365
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,359
Rym: And if you go to Pax East, the Westin lobby is enormous and there's a million people in there playing games.

366
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,339
Rym: Like so crowded.

367
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,260
Scott: It even has that little balcony mezzanine area with extra big round tables that are used for gaming.

368
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,780
Rym: But it's so crowded, like I avoid that place like the plague for the last few years.

369
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,560
Rym: So it's always been a problem because there's nowhere for everyone to game on Thursday except there.

370
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,240
Rym: Like you go over to the Seaport Hotel, despite having a ton of space, there's like no one playing games.

371
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,924
Scott: Well, it's also.

372
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,560
Scott: a lot of these hotel lobbies aren't convenient for gaming.

373
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,900
Scott: Hotel lobby tables are usually tiny weird circle tables or low coffee tables for newspapers and shit.

374
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,060
Rym: But there's multiple factors.

375
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,440
Scott: Yeah, no one has gaming tables set up in there, right?

376
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,500
Scott: I mean, I'm pretty sure like random poker games would break out when it's not a nerd convention.

377
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:59,340
Rym: But there's also the sort of like consensus critical mass where you need a... Like you have to have a certain critical mass of nerds who want to play games and then the hotel will be rocking.

378
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,180
Rym: If you're below that, it's just really sad unless you have your own small group of friends to just play games with.

379
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:05,699
Scott: We have that.

380
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:10,520
Rym: Yeah, but then it's just like you're in your hotel room except it's slightly bigger.

381
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Rym: So PAX East for the first time ever is solving this problem in the Westin.

382
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:20,459
Scott: The big hotel that everyone wants to stay in.

383
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,099
Rym: That no attendees are staying in as far as I can tell.

384
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:24,539
Rym: It's all exhibitors.

385
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,719
Rym: I mean, we could not even get into the stupid Westin.

386
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,139
Scott: No, because we're so special.

387
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:36,660
Rym: Well, enforcers and panelists and all the early access gave us no access to that stupid hotel.

388
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,560
Rym: We could have stayed in the Westin if there was one of us and we were only staying Friday and Saturday.

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,400
Rym: So there's a big event space, 21,000 square feet in the basement of that hotel that PAX never used.

390
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,259
Rym: Like no one uses it.

391
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,180
Scott: I mean, I thought I was imagining this space because I've been down the stairs in the Westin.

392
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Rym: Yeah, there's a hallway there.

393
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,540
Scott: We played a lot of Wizard down there in the restaurant part, but there's another room down there and stuff.

394
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,740
Scott: And I thought that that was the space.

395
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,440
Rym: Wait, Scott, the restaurant part is like up and around to the right.

396
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:09,937
Scott: There's a space down the stairs.

397
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:10,140
Scott: Remember?

398
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
Rym: Yeah, it's just a wide hallway.

399
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Scott: No, because there were like lights that were shining on the wall with like graphics and stuff down there.

400
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,260
Rym: Yeah, that's just a long hallway.

401
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,060
Scott: Anyway, there's stuff down there.

402
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,100
Rym: That's where we played Vampire Rob Mafia that one day.

403
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,719
Scott: I'm just saying is apparently this space is not a space that is in my brain.

404
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,080
Scott: Because it's some other space I haven't been to.

405
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,884
Rym: It's a ballroom.

406
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:29,990
Rym: It's an expo hall.

407
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,814
Rym: It's 21,000 square feet.

408
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:37,995
Rym: And for whatever reason, the hotel said, "Hey, PAX people, you can just use it.

409
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:38,938
Rym: We're not even going to charge

410
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,058
Rym: you.".

411
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,958
Scott: Are you sure they're not charging anyone for this?

412
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:50,753
Rym: It appears that they're not charging anyone for this because there's an interesting quote, "Zero gaming will be allowed in the actual hotel lobby anywhere.

413
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,659
Rym: You will be forced to go to this gaming

414
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:52,940
Rym: area.".

415
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,560
Rym: The hotel is trying to get the thousands of PAX people who crowd their lobby every year out of their hair.

416
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,040
Scott: I mean, usually like other hotels, for example, share it in at PAX West, right?

417
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,020
Scott: It's like, if that bothers them, they haven't done anything about it.

418
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,960
Scott: I don't understand why the hotel cares.

419
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:12,600
Scott: Like, why is the hotel being nice and helping us out?

420
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,012
Scott: It's sort of like, "Really?

421
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,079
Scott: You're helping us out,

422
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,280
Scott: huh?".

423
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,240
Rym: Well, as far as I can tell, the mezzanine, which is in that area, some other convention has that space rented out on Thursday.

424
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,459
Scott: That's dumb of them.

425
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:33,630
Rym: And those people, there might have been trouble because that space that they've rented out last year was full of probably seven or eight hundred PAX.

426
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,800
Rym: people like mashed together, sitting on the floor everywhere.

427
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:44,800
Rym: So the hotel will fucking kick you out if you don't go downstairs to play games in the dungeon, but the dungeon is going to be gigantic.

428
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:49,919
Scott: It's like, we want the dungeon, but this still is making me very cautious.

429
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,530
Scott: Like, when you go down the street and there's a guy and he's handing out some candy, and you're like, "Really?

430
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,896
Scott: That's not poison candy.

431
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:58,458
Scott: Is that what you're

432
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:58,779
Scott: saying?".

433
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,716
Rym: The ones I don't get lately, there's all these people in my office that are just like, "Free massage, free

434
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:03,920
Rym: massage.".

435
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,684
Rym: And I'm like, "Hell no.

436
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:09,998
Rym: Hell no, you're not touching me, scary hobo-looking dude with a

437
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:10,379
Rym: sign.".

438
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:11,139
Scott: That's right.

439
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:15,320
Scott: They're trying to convince you to come in for their paid massage or their Chinese...

440
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,700
Rym: And it's a hobo that was hired by the whatever.

441
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,880
Scott: Or their Chinese nonsense or their chiropractors or whatever their evil nonsense is.

442
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:28,140
Rym: So at least 350 seats with a bunch of tables, also tons of floor space.

443
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:31,160
Rym: They're setting up JS Joust and you can just game on the floor.

444
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,639
Rym: They're trying to get a bar put down there.

445
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,580
Scott: I'm sure the hotel will be happy with putting a bar down there.

446
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,680
Rym: I'll be happy if they put a bar down there.

447
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,739
Scott: Free money for them.

448
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:48,920
Rym: So this is going to be amazing and this actually really ups the value of PAX East in relation to the other PAXes.

449
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:49,494
Scott: Sure, yeah.

450
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,300
Rym: Because Prime's the only other PAX that has...

451
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,160
Scott: If they kept it going every night after the end of PAX, that would be even better.

452
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,550
Scott: If they turned it into... Because this is a Thursday night thing.

453
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,940
Scott: Is it going to be a Friday night thing?

454
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,220
Rym: I think it's just Thursday because...

455
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,740
Scott: When does PAX end on Friday?

456
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,480
Rym: Well, because I'm pretty sure on Friday the mezzanine and everything will be available again.

457
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,923
Scott: Oh, okay.

458
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,300
Scott: But the mezzanine doesn't hold nearly as much as a giant ballroom.

459
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,340
Rym: Thursday is the most important though because the other news, as far as I can tell...

460
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Scott: It is the most important.

461
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,019
Rym: Because, you know, Wizards of the Coast isn't...

462
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,680
Scott: But so is Sunday after the con ends.

463
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,340
Rym: Wizards of the Coast isn't exhibiting and taking up all the space that they always take up, at least in the tabletop areas.

464
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,920
Scott: That is correct, but we don't know if that space will be used for more tabletop or not.

465
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:32,080
Rym: I suspect there's going to be a lot more tabletop space at this PAX East than there's ever been.

466
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,240
Scott: Maybe, that would be nice.

467
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
Rym: Independent of the Westin stuff.

468
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,217
Scott: But they could expand other areas to take that WotC space instead.

469
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:38,600
Scott: We don't know.

470
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,366
Rym: Yeah.

471
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:40,340
Rym: So I got one last news.

472
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:46,160
Scott: But I think they shouldn't because just because WotC's not there doesn't mean there won't be an equal number of people playing Magic.

473
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,300
Rym: True, but the only reason those Magic people are in our way is because that space is reserved for them.

474
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,200
Scott: Right, but what I'm saying is that if WotC doesn't show up, you're still going to need all those tables to accommodate people playing Magic on their own.

475
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,440
Rym: But as soon as they stand up, my Carcassonne game starts there.

476
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,848
Scott: Sure.

477
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,220
Rym: One last little news because this is kind of hilarious.

478
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:11,020
Rym: Someone hacked Steam and there was a way to use their API.

479
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,773
Scott: And Steam is like a really bad thing.

480
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:13,800
Scott: It's really garbage anyway.

481
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,063
Rym: No, but this was an interesting hack.

482
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:20,213
Rym: They basically were able to list a game in Steam that you could buy.

483
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,300
Rym: that literally no one at Valve knew about or had looked at.

484
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,980
Scott: Whoa, that's pretty crazy.

485
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,700
Rym: So it was a security researcher who did it and he did it as a joke.

486
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,260
Rym: He was going to have the game appear on April Fool's Day and the game is called Watch Paint Dry.

487
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,600
Rym: And it's basically just paint drying.

488
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,183
Scott: I'm telling you, Valve, hire me.

489
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:43,138
Scott: I'm going to redo all of Steam so that when you click on your inventory, it'll load instantly and won't be like...

490
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,340
Rym: Why would I even want to ever click on my inventory?

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,969
Scott: I'm just saying there's so much shit in Steam.

492
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,837
Scott: Because Steam is basically just a website, right?

493
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:51,620
Scott: Which is what I can make.

494
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,906
Scott: And it's really awful, right?

495
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,820
Scott: The Steam app is mostly just a browser with this website in it.

496
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:03,120
Scott: And the website's real bad and it's real slow and I think it's all Microsoft-based actually on the back end.

497
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:08,320
Scott: I could just rewrite that whole fucking thing, especially with a team of great Valve developers.

498
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,960
Scott: Well, maybe their web developers aren't so great, but I get some other ones, redo that whole thing, and it would be amazing.

499
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:23,920
Scott: And I'm sure that people also, the people who are game developers and publishers, putting their games on Steam have to deal with a lot of web interfaces and stuff that really suck.

500
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,700
Scott: That I could also improve.

501
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,278
Rym: Well, I mean, our friend Conrad has complained every time he's ever had to interact with Steam on the back end, so...

502
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,001
Scott: Yep.

503
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:36,015
Scott: Valve is just bad at the back end things.

504
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,078
Scott: It all started...

505
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,608
Rym: Well, are they bad at it?

506
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,240
Rym: Because they do a better job than anyone else.

507
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
Scott: Or they just don't care, right?

508
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:43,620
Rym: Who does a good job on this stuff?

509
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,060
Scott: No one else is doing this stuff.

510
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,040
Rym: No, I'm saying who does a good job on this sort of web front end, back end type stuff anywhere?

511
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,720
Rym: WordPress.

512
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,179
Scott: Alright, we got one.

513
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:57,280
Scott: Any sort of, you know, thing that you would set up, like, you know, GitHub or, you know...

514
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:57,859
Rym: No, they're okay.

515
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:01,099
Scott: Amazon web services is much better than Steam.

516
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,500
Rym: The Amazon console is really, of course, that's more bad UX.

517
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,819
Scott: I'm just saying it's better than Steam.

518
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,476
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

519
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,064
Scott: It's better than Steam.

520
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,012
Scott: It works, right?

521
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,060
Scott: It's not some, you know...

522
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,725
Rym: It does work.

523
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:10,480
Rym: Of course, I haven't had problems with Steam in a while.

524
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,696
Scott: I'm just saying, it's, you know, it's not like some weird slow-loading pages and shit, right?

525
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:15,640
Scott: It's way better than Steam.

526
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,060
Scott: Things of the day!

527
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:24,840
Scott: What was my thing?

528
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,732
Rym: Scott found this independent of me.

529
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:27,798
Rym: He messaged it to me, like, "Holy

530
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,040
Rym: crap!".

531
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,460
Rym: But I'd already, like, flagged it as my thing of the day.

532
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,655
Scott: I was just using it to sort of make some trash talk.

533
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,160
Scott: that's definitely not going to actually happen.

534
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
Scott: Because, as we know already, I suck at civilization.

535
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,435
Scott: But I was like, "It's about a Bronze Age

536
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:40,819
Scott: battle.".

537
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Scott: And Rym, in the two-player game we're playing, Rym is Egypt and I'm China.

538
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,753
Scott: So I'm like, "See that skull with the spear in it?

539
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,458
Scott: That's gonna be Ramsay's real

540
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:51,779
Scott: soon.".

541
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,554
Scott: "In his crystal ball, this is what he

542
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:54,098
Scott: sees.".

543
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:55,359
Rym: Are you threatening me?

544
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,080
Scott: I'm just being silly threatening you.

545
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,023
Scott: I'm gonna go at the beginning of this.

546
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:04,220
Rym: In 1996, an amateur archaeologist found a single upper arm bone sticking out of a riverbank.

547
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:04,960
Scott: Alright.

548
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:06,939
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

549
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,276
Rym: A flint arrowhead was firmly embedded in one end of the bone.

550
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,020
Rym: It was a really good picture.

551
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:15,054
Scott: So that tells you basically immediately, "This isn't some recent murder that I'm worried about.

552
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:15,917
Scott: This is an old-ass

553
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,279
Scott: bone.".

554
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:18,587
Rym: Or, maybe someone in 1910 was like, "You know what?

555
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:18,728
Rym: Flint

556
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:19,029
Rym: arrowheads.".

557
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:24,987
Rym: And they thought, "Alright.

558
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,352
Rym: Murder something.

559
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:27,376
Rym: Maybe a small battle.

560
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:27,818
Rym: We'll figure it

561
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:27,999
Rym: out.".

562
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,558
Rym: But they found evidence of a massive organized battle from at least 3,000 years ago.

563
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,247
Scott: So they found this in 1910, so 3,000 years ago.

564
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,562
Scott: No, no.

565
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,031
Rym: They found this in 1996.

566
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:43,400
Rym: I was saying it was a 100-year-old murder.

567
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,181
Scott: Oh.

568
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:48,621
Scott: So 1996 minus 3,000 is... 1250 BC.

569
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,904
Scott: BC.

570
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:50,565
Scott: BCE.

571
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,223
Rym: Way old.

572
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:52,820
Scott: Yup.

573
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,505
Scott: Mad old.

574
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,777
Scott: Like, not medieval times.

575
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,407
Scott: Sick old.

576
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:57,319
Scott: Bronze age.

577
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,640
Rym: This is interesting.

578
00:26:58,961 --> 00:26:59,316
Rym: Bronze.

579
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:08,080
Rym: Because there is literally no recorded evidence, no circumstantial evidence, no references, nothing.

580
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:17,700
Rym: Indicating that humanity knew anything about a battle, significant civilizations, anything in that region, even remotely close to that era.

581
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,617
Rym: And at first they thought, "Well, maybe there was a bunch of battles here over a long period of

582
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:21,919
Rym: time.".

583
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,131
Scott: Were they sure it was people?

584
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,600
Scott: They sure it wasn't like a Neanderthal war?

585
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,740
Rym: It's definitely people.

586
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,719
Scott: It wasn't a monkey war?

587
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,580
Rym: Definitely people.

588
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:29,256
Scott: Elephant war?

589
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,779
Rym: They found a lot of well-constructed bronze weapons, which in that era...

590
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:34,637
Scott: Alien war?

591
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,040
Rym: The bronze weapons in this time period would have been like the cream of the crop, like experimental weapons effectively.

592
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,155
Rym: And it was definitely armed conflicts.

593
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:47,080
Rym: Organized armed conflicts.

594
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,969
Scott: Yeah, I mean this arrowhead stuck in bones.

595
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:51,300
Scott: That's a pretty sick arrowhead if you can get it all the way down to the bones.

596
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:59,500
Rym: But there is a big difference between armed conflict, like it could be a bunch of farmers fighting over whatever, and organized armies armed conflicts.

597
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,661
Rym: Right.

598
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,792
Scott: It's not a plowshare that was stuck in a dude's head.

599
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:02,838
Scott: It was an arrowhead.

600
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,781
Rym: Yup.

601
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:08,580
Rym: One side definitely won because they found that basically all the bodies that would have been accessible were looted.

602
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,859
Rym: And all the ones that were buried deep in water had a whole bunch of jewelry and stuff on them.

603
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:25,720
Rym: And this article is just really fascinating because as much as we think we know about history, occasionally we find things like this that kind of blow up our whole perception of the history of the world.

604
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,489
Scott: Also, the photos here are sick.

605
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,540
Scott: Like the dude's skull with the spear stuck in it.

606
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:30,062
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:33,840
Rym: I do not ever want a flint arrowhead to be embedded that deeply into my arm bone.

608
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,903
Scott: Yeah, listen guys.

609
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:41,200
Scott: Everyone who's currently doing some Civil War reenacting, I'm sure in Europe they do some Bronze Age battle reenacting.

610
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,380
Scott: And then we can find out who the people in Europe are who are the types that would reenact.

611
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,943
Scott: So this gets even crazier.

612
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:56,520
Rym: They look at this thing and they're like, well maybe there's a bunch of conflicts over a long period of time, but based on the evidence at the site, no, it was one gigantic battle.

613
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,709
Rym: And then in 2013 they found a 120 meter long bridge used to be there.

614
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:13,400
Rym: So this was a giant battle over a gigantic bridge from a time and a place where we really didn't think there were organized people.

615
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,718
Scott: And we didn't think people knew how to make a bridge.

616
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,675
Rym: I mean, let alone just, there's so much going on in this article.

617
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:21,939
Scott: This is amazing.

618
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,820
Scott: I'm sure this is real and not one of those people making a fake discovery to be famous with bullshit.

619
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,038
Rym: Nah, this seems pretty legit.

620
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,980
Scott: There's a lot of fraud in archaeology, right?

621
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,322
Rym: Yeah, that has happened.

622
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:41,360
Rym: Here, quote, standardized metal weaponry and the remains of horses, which were found intermingled with human bones at one spot, suggest there are at least some combatants that were well equipped, well trained.

623
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,732
Rym: Quote, these weren't farmer soldiers who went out every few years for a brawl.

624
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:48,240
Rym: These are professional fighters.

625
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,040
Rym: So I'm really curious to see what we can figure out from this as they start to continue to study this site.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,220
Rym: And it kind of raises interesting questions about how old the civilizations in Europe really are.

627
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,099
Scott: Because, you know, sick old.

628
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:14,080
Rym: Well, you know, the guns, germs and steel thing, the idea that the animals in Europe and the climate just happened to be more usable by humans, which gave Europe a head start.

629
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:20,040
Rym: The counter theory to that is that humans were just in Europe a lot longer than we thought and made it that way.

630
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,909
Scott: Well, sorry, guns, germs and steel.

631
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,560
Scott: Evidence is not helping you out.

632
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,021
Rym: Yep.

633
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,159
Rym: So, yeah, this is really cool stuff.

634
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:27,122
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:28,486
Scott: It's like, oh, why was Europe better?

636
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,188
Scott: I don't know.

637
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,140
Scott: They built bridges while everyone else was still like, you know, cave people.

638
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:33,681
Rym: Yeah.

639
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:37,820
Rym: Why did so much military force conversion a narrow river valley in northern Germany?

640
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:38,799
Scott: It was a bridge there.

641
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:39,281
Rym: Yeah.

642
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:42,549
Rym: This is a period of significant upheaval in the Mediterranean to the Baltic.

643
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,760
Rym: In Greece, the Mycenaean civilization was collapsing around the time of the battle.

644
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,878
Rym: Mycenaeans, man.

645
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,558
Scott: That's my people.

646
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,020
Rym: Yeah.

647
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,014
Rym: In Egypt, pharaohs boasted about having defeated the sea people.

648
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,660
Rym: So it's during all those times.

649
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Scott: Cyclopians.

650
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:57,823
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,449
Rym: Unknown horrors of the deep.

652
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,640
Rym: So you got a thing of the day?

653
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,565
Scott: Yeah, I do have a thing.

654
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:05,840
Scott: So this is sort of like a mainstream thing of the day.

655
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,759
Scott: It was all over like the trash news in, you know, basically the New York Post of the U.K.

656
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Rym: It's like basic story.

657
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,501
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:16,980
Scott: But I think this is something not a lot of nerds have seen because it was all over the mainstream Internet.

659
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:17,988
Scott: And it's really cool.

660
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,539
Scott: Even if you don't care about sports here.

661
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:20,476
Rym: I have not seen this.

662
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,001
Scott: Yeah.

663
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:21,865
Scott: Here is a dude.

664
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,617
Scott: He's a 50 year old fisherman, which is pretty cool.

665
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:25,300
Scott: You know, fisherman.

666
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Scott: It's a good thing to be.

667
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,825
Scott: If you're like a professional fisherman, that's cool.

668
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:31,696
Scott: But he's sort of fat and blobby, you know, but he's not so fat and blobby.

669
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:32,498
Scott: He can't get around.

670
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,240
Scott: He's just fat and blobby.

671
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,560
Rym: He can really get around.

672
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,506
Scott: And he can fucking get around with the soccer ball.

673
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,428
Scott: Let me tell you what.

674
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:39,351
Scott: Like, whoa.

675
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,398
Scott: Like, the skills are so high with this dude.

676
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,160
Scott: It's ridiculous.

677
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:53,300
Scott: It's like, you know, it's sort of like when you see like that, you know, people are always shocked to see like an ugly person sing because usually in the music industry, they only let pretty people sing.

678
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,100
Scott: Right.

679
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:55,543
Scott: No, this is like that.

680
00:31:55,623 --> 00:32:03,880
Scott: It's like usually you only see fit people doing athletics because, you know, you think how only fit people can do this like this is probably mad fit underneath all that blubber.

681
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:08,247
Scott: But he's got the mad coordination and skills and it's awesome to watch him.

682
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:15,540
Scott: And I hope maybe he could like, you know, get fit and then he could be a soccer player because he obviously likes playing soccer.

683
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,340
Scott: So maybe he could be a soccer player and a fisherman.

684
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:24,900
Rym: Also, there was that TED talk a while ago and a bunch of research backing it showing that like it's better to be skinnier, like it's better to not be obese.

685
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,525
Rym: Like if you can just don't be fat.

686
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:32,100
Rym: But if you're already fat, well, it's really, really difficult to unfat.

687
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,583
Rym: And for some people, it might be impossible.

688
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:42,120
Rym: if you're fit, like if you're physically fit and you exercise, even if you remain fat, you're like 95 percent as healthy as someone who's that fit and skinny.

689
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,909
Rym: Like you're doing pretty well.

690
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:46,000
Rym: If you can move around, this guy's probably doing all right.

691
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,523
Scott: I mean, you know, this is you can always tell.

692
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:49,084
Scott: Right.

693
00:32:49,484 --> 00:33:01,600
Scott: You know, you see like really large, obese type people, the ones that are like a ton of muscle and, you know, that just happens to have fat around it, like the bouncer at the nightclub where it's like fucking with that guy.

694
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:02,282
Scott: Right.

695
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:05,960
Scott: And then the person who's in the rover, whatever thing can walk.

696
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,560
Rym: Well, even though they might weigh the same like NFL, the fat guy in the NFL, he would kill either one of us if he was in the same room and mad at us.

697
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:13,781
Scott: Yeah.

698
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,067
Scott: You know, I think B.J.

699
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,439
Scott: Raji just retired, but it's like, yeah, you're fucking with B.J.

700
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:19,727
Scott: B.J.,

701
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,499
Scott: what's up?

702
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,712
Rym: In the moment we're going we were just at Anime Boston.

703
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,214
Rym: Stay tuned.

704
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,400
Rym: I'll try to get videos up soon.

705
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:30,953
Rym: For those of you who care about Kinetic Con, I finally can open panel submissions.

706
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,940
Rym: The secret is the form's already open, but I haven't tested it yet.

707
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,946
Rym: So I'm going to futz around with it and I'm going to announce stuff.

708
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,992
Rym: But go ahead and submit now if you want.

709
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:40,280
Rym: If you're listening to GeekNights, you know the drill.

710
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:46,613
Rym: Next weekend, this coming week, so this weekend, actually, I will be without Scott.

711
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,860
Rym: Well, I'll have a different Scott at Zenkai Con on Saturday.

712
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Rym: I'm doing how to run an anime club, analyzing anime, utenna and practical game theory.

713
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,375
Scott: He's not telling you is that this convention is in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

714
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,460
Scott: Don't fucking go there.

715
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,660
Rym: Unless you live, only go to Zenkai Con if you live within a couple hours drive.

716
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:15,179
Scott: If you live mad close, you can go on Saturday only, eat some Amish food, go to the con for a bit and then get the hell out before Sunday when they don't sell any Amish food because they're all Jesus-like.

717
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,241
Rym: Yeah.

718
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:24,498
Rym: This is a town where we went to a bar and I wanted to order beer and I asked the waitress what beers they had and they only had three, but that's fine.

719
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,020
Rym: Small town.

720
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:30,391
Rym: And she said she didn't want to say the name of the third beer.

721
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:33,938
Rym: and I was like, "What can you give me a

722
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:34,039
Rym: hint?".

723
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,487
Rym: And she was like, "It's arrogant

724
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:37,050
Rym: something.".

725
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,817
Rym: And I'm like, "Oh yeah, I'll have an arrogant

726
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:39,299
Rym: bastard.".

727
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:47,699
Rym: She visibly, physically flinched when I said the word bastard and got really uncomfortable around us for the entire evening.

728
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:48,818
Scott: Welcome to New York.

729
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,406
Rym: Also, fucking nothing is open on Sunday except one bar.

730
00:34:53,485 --> 00:35:02,920
Rym: Last year we just, after we did our last panel, well I did my last panel, those of us who were there just went to this bar and drank all day until we went home playing games.

731
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,943
Scott: Yeah, so don't go there.

732
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:10,520
Scott: Instead, if you're in New York City, a good place to be, the best place to be, the Mocha Festival is happening.

733
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,459
Scott: Yes, the Mocha Fest.

734
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:17,140
Scott: It's declined in recent years, I can't lie, but it's still worth a day of your time.

735
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,792
Rym: Yeah, there's awesome stuff there.

736
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:19,900
Rym: and Emily.

737
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,979
Scott: Emily bought a table so you can give her money if you want.

738
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,360
Rym: Emily's going to be selling a whole bunch of stuff at her table.

739
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,399
Scott: And she'll also be stuck in one place most of the time so she can't run away from you if you're that guy.

740
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,219
Rym: I see her shaking her head right now.

741
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:44,340
Rym: But yeah, if you want to read her book or buy her book or see a bunch of art or stuff, she'll have a bunch of her friend artist things and she'll have her own stuff.

742
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:50,820
Rym: And this is the first Mocha Fest in a long time that I'm missing because Scott and I can't both bail on Zenkai Con.

743
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,411
Scott: Why not?

744
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,180
Rym: Professionals, we don't bail on a con.

745
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,667
Scott: I mean, you should have bailed earlier.

746
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,511
Scott: You could have bailed earlier.

747
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,436
Scott: You just waited too long.

748
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,039
Scott: Now you're stuck.

749
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,248
Rym: Remember, one, Zenkai Con is pretty fun.

750
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:02,740
Rym: And two, that's an audience that we don't reach.

751
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,339
Scott: Like, when I present a Zenkai Con- I don't need- Listen, I'm not going to reach someone who's going to wince when I say, "Fuck

752
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,460
Scott: you.".

753
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:11,700
Rym: But a lot of the kids who go to the con are coming from Philly anyway.

754
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,478
Rym: But I'm telling you, the kids at this con- Fuck them!

755
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:15,150
Rym: We'll get like a hundred people in the room.

756
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,840
Scott: None of them- If you live in Philly, you can go fuck yourself.

757
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,270
Rym: I remember last year, one of the panels, I filled the room.

758
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:24,380
Rym: No one in the room knew who I was or knew about GeekNights or anything.

759
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,940
Rym: Half of them didn't know what podcasts were and- Yeah, because they're from fucking Philly.

760
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:31,349
Scott: I don't need these people.

761
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,019
Scott: I don't want to go anywhere near them.

762
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,027
Rym: I got to reach out.

763
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,660
Rym: I got to evangelize the geekery.

764
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:35,984
Scott: No.

765
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,099
Scott: Why not?

766
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,960
Rym: I thought that was the mission of GeekNights, to expand horizons.

767
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,279
Scott: Philadelphia people, they just need a little scorched earth policy down there.

768
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Rym: The book, I don't know why you hate Philly so much.

769
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:49,399
Rym: Philly, I would rather live in than most other cities in the U.S.

770
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:54,580
Scott: I mean, I guess compared to say like Jacksonville, Florida or something.

771
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,764
Rym: I said cities.

772
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:58,019
Rym: There's a lot of cities that you don't want to live in.

773
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,719
Rym: Philly at least is cosplaying a city.

774
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:08,740
Rym: Right after Zeikai Con, like a few weeks, PAX East, as we said- A real convention.

775
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,080
Rym: Well, we'll be there on Sunday doing Atari game design.

776
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,739
Rym: And yeah, then other conventions coming up after that.

777
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,978
Rym: The next Book Club book's going to be Margaret Atwood, Orcs and Crake.

778
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:23,978
Rym: And I think I'm going to stop reading The Wheel of Time after I finish the 11th one.

779
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,440
Rym: And then I'm going to start reading that.

780
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,119
Scott: Alright, I already got a copy, so I'm good.

781
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,580
Rym: Tell me when you started.

782
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,159
Scott: I also picked- I found a book- you stole my Book Club book.

783
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,786
Scott: So I found another one.

784
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:37,737
Scott: that's, you know, maybe the most GeekNights book I've ever seen.

785
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:38,720
Scott: that isn't Prince of Nothing.

786
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:39,766
Scott: How?

787
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:41,100
Rym: Okay, other than Prince of Nothing.

788
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:45,465
Rym: We'll see.

789
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:47,340
Rym: I'm vaguely trusting.

790
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,080
Rym: So at PAX South, we needed a short game to play.

791
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:52,900
Scott: I played this game at ConnectiCon last year.

792
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,398
Rym: Yeah, and I did not, because I was doing work.

793
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,659
Rym: So you want to introduce the game then?

794
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,522
Scott: Yeah, okay.

795
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,409
Scott: So it's a really tiny game.

796
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:02,340
Scott: It's published by Mayfair, who I guess used to publish Settlers.

797
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,499
Rym: Yeah, it's a Wolfgang Kringemührer game, so.

798
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:07,760
Scott: And it's a little tiny card game, and it's called Six Nymphs.

799
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,840
Scott: And there's actually a whole lot going on in this tiny card game, and most of the things I have to say about it are positive.

800
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:22,248
Rym: Yeah, it's a- there are a lot of little games like this, like No Thanks, like all those sort of like, "Hey, it's real easy to teach.

801
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:23,334
Rym: Just start playing it.

802
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:23,896
Rym: You'll have some

803
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:24,158
Rym: fun.".

804
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,380
Rym: But usually those games do not hold people's attention.

805
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,040
Rym: Like, if I bust out No Thanks, people really like it once, but no one wants to play it again right then and there.

806
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,978
Scott: Yeah, Six Nymphs you can play quite a few times.

807
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:46,360
Rym: I mean, I've taught this to people who were drinking, and had been drinking, and were yelling and socializing, and not paying attention too much, and then they are really into the game.

808
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,409
Scott: Well, the fun part of the game, right, so here's the-.

809
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,880
Scott: so you know Nym, Nym is the game that Rym likes, where you have sticks, and on your turn you pick up sticks, and whoever picks up the last stick loses.

810
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,860
Scott: So it's got that unstable, stable state, combinatorial game theory going on, right?

811
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:02,800
Scott: Six Nymt is basically the same game, that's why it's called Nymt, right?

812
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,083
Scott: It's just more advanced.

813
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:07,635
Scott: There's a deck of cards numbered from 1 to 104, and there's four rows.

814
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,620
Scott: And on your turn, and everyone simultaneously turns- Two to ten players.

815
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,345
Scott: Yeah, that's great, so many players.

816
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:23,160
Scott: You take a card from your hand of random cards, everyone has the same size hand, and put it face down, and then everyone simultaneously reveals.

817
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:39,840
Scott: Starting with the lowest card, the cards are added to the appropriate row, the appropriate row being the row in which there is a- the rightmost card is lower than the card the person has played, and then amongst those rows, which of the cards is the highest.

818
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,700
Scott: So if I play a 30, and one of the rows is a 29 in its rightmost spot, my 30 is going there, right?

819
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:55,588
Scott: If I play a 74, and there's a row with a 94, a 63, and a 52, it's going in the row with the 63, because that's the highest number.

820
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,600
Scott: that's lower than my 70, whatever I just said.

821
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,380
Scott: So you just keep- everyone simultaneously reveals, and plays cards out there.

822
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,919
Scott: Pretty simple, that's the whole rules of how to play the game, but it's Six Nymt.

823
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:15,483
Scott: If you play the sixth card in a row, meaning there are already five cards in a row, and your card gets forced into that row, you take

824
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,287
Rym: all those cards,

825
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:22,660
Scott: you take all the five cards that are already there, and your sixth card replaces that row, and is now starting a new row.

826
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:31,340
Scott: When you take those cards, all the cards have little pictures of bulls on them, some cards have more bullshit than others, whoever has the least bullshit wins.

827
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,700
Scott: So you don't want to play the sixth card in a row.

828
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:46,980
Scott: Also, the only other rule, if you play a card, and the number on that card is lower than the rightmost cards of every row of all four rows, you pick a row to take, it could be a tiny row with only one card in it, which would be awesome.

829
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,440
Rym: There might not be a tiny row.

830
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:56,240
Scott: There might not be a tiny row, and then your card makes a new row that is lower than all the other rows, and then everyone else's card comes out according to the rules.

831
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:05,860
Rym: And then it's basically hearts rules, you keep playing until someone hits 66, because six is a number in this game, and then whoever has the lowest score wins, if there's a tie, joint victory, it's a whole game.

832
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,119
Scott: Right, so here's what makes the game really interesting, right?

833
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,199
Rym: It's got some gobs going on, other than that, not all the cards are out.

834
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:21,420
Rym: So, nothing changes, you've got ten cards, you've got to play all ten, everyone's got to play ten cards.

835
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,380
Scott: It's just which order you're going to play them in, right?

836
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,180
Scott: So you're looking at the board state, and there's different moves you can try.

837
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:38,040
Scott: For example, if there's not a lot of cards in the rows, maybe you could just try to get rid of your low cards, and take some low points, and then hope later in the round you'll be safe, and other people end up taking the big cards.

838
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:49,760
Rym: But, if you have only high cards, the board could get a range, or the table could get a range in such a way, that all the high cards you have are very likely to take some old terrible row that's full of bulls.

839
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,260
Scott: Right, also, let's say you've got the 104 in your hand, the highest card in the game.

840
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:57,080
Scott: You could try to play it right away, and that would basically go in the final row.

841
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,620
Scott: Like, say the final row has a 54 in it, you could put the 104 right next to it, and now anything less than 104 is going in row three.

842
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:10,000
Scott: And nothing new is going in row four at all, because nothing's higher than 104.

843
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:25,160
Scott: And now, someone puts a 90-something in row three, and now every new card is going in rows one and two, and suddenly, the game gets really hairy until somebody plays a super low card, and intentionally takes row three and four, and you can create this lockdown effect, right?

844
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,246
Scott: So you have all these different ways you can play.

845
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:46,020
Scott: You could intentionally try to take those rows to unlock the game, and maybe you'll get less points now in order to get even, you know, to lower the total points you would've taken if you didn't open the game up, or maybe you can just keep holding out, hoping that someone else bites the bullet, and ends up taking the nymph, and then you can clear your hand and get zero points, and woo!

846
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,447
Rym: And, yeah, like, think about that.

847
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:53,404
Rym: you've played that strategy of, I play the high number to lock something down, so I play the 104.

848
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:58,560
Rym: What if all the other players play, like, 55, 58, 60, and then I just take the row and I'm completely screwed?

849
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:14,307
Scott: Sometimes there'd be only a little bit of space between rows, and, like, you have the card that fits there, and, like, and, like, there'll be a 94 in a row, and the next row has, like, 100 in it, so the only cards that can go in that third row would be, like, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, so only, like, five or six cards, right?

850
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,985
Scott: And there's four cards in the row.

851
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:22,494
Scott: Someone else is like, "Ahaha, I'll play my 97,".

852
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:28,213
Scott: and then it'll go right there in that row, and there's no way I'm taking that row, 'cause no one's gonna play any card, right?

853
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:35,180
Scott: And someone else is gonna have to take that row, and somebody sneaks in with, like, one of the two cards that could've fucked you, and now you take that row.

854
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,217
Scott: It's like,

855
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:36,380
Scott: "Ahhh!".

856
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:43,320
Rym: What is fascinating is how drastically different the game is with every number of players.

857
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,040
Scott: Oh, huge difference.

858
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,500
Rym: The three-player game, the four-player game.

859
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:45,980
Scott: Tremendous differences.

860
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,218
Rym: Might as well be different games.

861
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:47,717
Scott: Oh, yeah.

862
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:57,740
Scott: When you play, once you get to six players, that makes the biggest gap, because suddenly, you can just, boom, oh, actually, with five players, 'cause every row already has a card in it, right?

863
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:06,780
Scott: As soon as you get to five players, it changes drastically, 'cause if everyone plays a card for the same row, you can just play something that looked totally safe and end up taking a whole bunch of cards right away.

864
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:30,000
Rym: Yep, like, in three- and four-player, there'll be rows where everyone is guaranteed to be able to play something safe, and as a result, the game will often get locked up pretty quick, and then it'll come down to, did the person who locked it up have cards to make the game cycle where they will, every round, take no points, and someone else will take a bunch of points, which we saw happen reliably.

865
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,520
Rym: There was always one person who just got wrecked in that situation.

866
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,300
Scott: I mean, I can't say this game has a lot of strategy, but it also has a lot of luck, right?

867
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,020
Scott: At the beginning of the game, you deal with, what, ten cards to every player?

868
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,392
Rym: Yep, and there's 104 cards in the deck.

869
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,480
Scott: So even if you play with the max of ten players, there's four missing cards, right?

870
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,727
Scott: But there is significant luck.

871
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:47,760
Scott: If you could just get, like, all low cards, it could happen.

872
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,234
Scott: But!

873
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,324
Scott: There's no reason it couldn't happen.

874
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:53,560
Scott: You can get a really bad mix of cards such that you're just screwed.

875
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,180
Rym: But playing multiple games and all that actually helps a lot.

876
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,480
Rym: The fact that you keep playing games of it.

877
00:44:59,540 --> 00:44:59,862
Scott: Right, yes.

878
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,840
Scott: Because it's not one round doesn't determine the whole thing, right?

879
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:13,900
Scott: You play until someone gets 66, so even if you get screwed one round, you play enough rounds that theoretically, if you're good at the game, you're gonna win because it evens out over the course, right?

880
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:15,619
Rym: Yep, yep.

881
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:25,600
Scott: So what makes the game super fun, even if you don't get to the deep strategies and everything, is just that nymph mechanic is like an exciting hot potato kind of deal.

882
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:32,009
Scott: The drama of there's this row building up with a bunch of bulls in it, and who's gonna, is someone gonna take it?

883
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,633
Scott: Is somebody forced to take it because they have a bad card and they're just holding out waiting to play it?

884
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,636
Rym: It's a game where everyone's cards go out safely, and then everyone's like, "Oh no!

885
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:40,138
Rym: Oh

886
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:40,360
Rym: no!".

887
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,978
Rym: because there's a bunch of full rows and it's super dangerous.

888
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,400
Scott: It's like when someone takes the big row, it's like the hot potato exploded on them.

889
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:46,744
Rym: Like,

890
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:46,805
Rym: "Oh!".

891
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,149
Rym: It ends up being a really high drama game.

892
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,840
Rym: Like, people get really intense about it.

893
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,280
Scott: Right, and what really increases the drama even more is that every card doesn't have the same number of bulls on it, right?

894
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,039
Scott: Some cards have just way more bulls on them.

895
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:08,180
Scott: So it's like, you could have a row and even only with two cards in it, could have more bulls than a row with like five cards that only have one bull each.

896
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,775
Scott: And that could be like, so someone could end up taking that, and it really sucks.

897
00:46:13,257 --> 00:46:13,980
Scott: Really sucks.

898
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,980
Rym: So, I guess what I'm really amazed by even more than that is the mechanical.

899
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:32,259
Rym: It's a sound game, it's quick to play, but people really like it, even though when you first show it to them, they see these hundred and four, you tell someone, "Alright, this game has cards numbered between one and a hundred and

900
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,500
Rym: four.".

901
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:40,280
Scott: And the only thing that's fun appearance-wise and aesthetically is the art is a little bit fun, right?

902
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,911
Scott: But it's just outlines of bullheads.

903
00:46:43,212 --> 00:46:44,459
Scott: There's not much going on there.

904
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:49,594
Scott: Other games have cute graphics or animals or characters.

905
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,420
Scott: It's just bullheads and numbers.

906
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,178
Rym: You kind of get to rope people in and be like, "Hey, I'll teach you the

907
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:54,380
Rym: game.".

908
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,159
Rym: And you can teach it so fast that they're like,

909
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:56,260
Rym: "Oh.".

910
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,244
Scott: I just taught it to you.

911
00:46:57,546 --> 00:47:02,246
Scott: Usually when we teach board games, we'll give sort of an explanation on the show, but not go into every detail.

912
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:05,100
Scott: I literally told you a hundred percent of the rules in this game.

913
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:12,700
Rym: But what makes the game great, the reason you can play it with people, even if they're distracted, even if they're drunk.

914
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,110
Scott: All you do is play a card.

915
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:16,760
Scott: There's no other weird decisions to make.

916
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:20,980
Scott: And then everything after the playing of the card is not decisions, but just execution.

917
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:28,960
Scott: If one person can do the execution, then it's drunk enough, at least sober enough to do the execution.

918
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,564
Rym: So think about that.

919
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:36,460
Rym: All you have to do is pick a card from your hand, thinking, and once everyone's ready, it's simultaneous reveal, and then there's no more thinking.

920
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,233
Rym: It's just play out what happens.

921
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:39,040
Rym: Play out the drama.

922
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,459
Scott: And you do it ten times game over.

923
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,001
Rym: Yup.

924
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:45,120
Rym: Now with ten players, you've dealt out a hundred cards.

925
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,000
Scott: The four left are the ones that start the rows.

926
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,308
Rym: So you pretty much know that every card's out there.

927
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,820
Rym: So then it becomes multiplayer GOPS, effectively.

928
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:59,300
Scott: Yeah, because you'll see, like, well, there's a 94 and a 97.

929
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:05,040
Scott: I could try for the 96, but I know the 95 exists and is in someone's hand because it hasn't been played yet.

930
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:09,920
Scott: But counting cards becomes a big deal because once a row is taken, you've got to remember what was in there.

931
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,140
Rym: Yeah, but at least unlike GOPS, one person might have the 96 and the 97 and the 98.

932
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,565
Rym: Like, you don't know.

933
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:18,000
Rym: It's not like everyone has the same hand.

934
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,379
Scott: That's entirely possible, yes.

935
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:24,960
Rym: Because the thing about GOPS to make it a hundred percent pure is that everyone has the exact same hand as well.

936
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,750
Rym: But if you need to get paid, this replaces No.

937
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,298
Rym: Thanks for Me as the "Hey guys, wanna play a quick

938
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:32,539
Rym: game?"

939
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:32,920
Rym: at a con.

940
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,544
Rym: Like, let's just go.

941
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:33,908
Rym: Play a game.

942
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,059
Rym: Spot it or this.

943
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:37,819
Rym: They're, like, perfect for this purpose.

944
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,625
Scott: Also, you can get this game way cheap.

945
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:43,720
Scott: I remember at PAX, they had it at the Mayfair booth, like, stacks of it, and it was, like, mad discounted.

946
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,480
Rym: I think I paid, like, four bucks for my copy.

947
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,786
Scott: Yeah, they're trying to get rid of these.

948
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:48,956
Scott: You can probably get two of these and give them as a gift.

949
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:49,880
Scott: Great gift.

950
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,380
Scott: Great gift for someone who plays some games or even the non-gamer type.

951
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:55,149
Scott: So cheap.

952
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,700
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

953
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,820
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

954
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,220
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

955
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:17,168
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

956
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:21,360
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

957
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,416
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

958
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,680
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

959
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,880
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

960
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:51,640
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights.

961
00:49:51,781 --> 00:50:34,520
Rym: In order of the amount of money they give us, if they give us at least $5 are... Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brandow, Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Chris Chien, thanks for consistently pronouncing it correctly, Kuntz, Jess, MyStady.com, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroz, Jeremy Minor, HowMuchMudGoodMudKipKipMudKipKipMud, Tyler Eller, Scott John Harrison, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rara Lavelle, Brian Cidroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silverheart, CantmeltSteelBeams, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, Sam Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Hadad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

962
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,900
Rym: So in the two player game of Civ, because I know Scott won't listen to this that we're playing right now, the one on the bus, he feels like he's doing okay.

963
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:49,250
Rym: He does not understand the extent of the army that I have hanging out on this island.

964
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:54,440
Rym: that I won't let him see because he only has one trireme and I just attack him anytime he comes anywhere near it.

965
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:02,720
Rym: I'm just massing troops over there and when we start the game on the way to PAX, I just have to pick the moment when I'm going to go over the sea and just destroy him.

966
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,328
Rym: So in the game we're playing now, I can see a hut.

967
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:07,051
Rym: I was lying.

968
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,294
Rym: I can definitely see a hut.

969
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:10,100
Rym: I want him to feel like he's getting ahead.

970
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:19,180
Rym: I want him to feel like he's really got things going on and I'm going to try to hide the army that I'm going to build like in a corner of the continent where he's not going to look like up north.

971
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:27,780
Rym: And I'm pretty confident that I can wait for a hilariously opportune moment and suddenly the forces come over the hill.

972
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,702
Rym: Stay tuned for all our stuff.

973
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:33,249
Rym: We did record Judge Anime by its cover at Anime Boston.

974
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:39,280
Rym: We also did record How to Run an Anime Club and Role Playing Anime.

975
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:47,120
Rym: So I might make those available to at least you patrons, even if they're not necessarily good enough quality to put on the general GeekNights, public whatever.

976
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:51,739
Rym: And now I leave you with something kind of weird and dumb.

977
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,959
Scott: Woman's log number 224 wrapped land isn't wrapping anymore.

978
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,245
Scott: Cooper took their king and the money too.

979
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,350
Rym: We're here to figure out what to do.

980
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:08,409
Rym: I'll bet Cooper's going to get that gold.

981
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,998
Scott: But how's he making them do what they're told?

982
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,065
Rym: I'm wrapping, Cooper.

983
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:25,029
Rym: Do what I say.

984
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:27,338
Rym: Bring me your gold coins right away.

985
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,100
Rym: Yo, King James, you're a dweeb.

986
00:52:37,742 --> 00:52:38,726
Rym: I run wrapped land.

987
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:39,750
Rym: I'm never going to leave.

988
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,238
Scott: Who be a chump, you ugly fang face?

989
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,809
Scott: My plaid boy is going to bring me from this place.

990
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,179
Scott: Plaid boy, smair boy, hey, hey, hey.
