1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,769
Rym: It's Thursday, July 1st, 2021.

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:09,950
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:13,196
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,685
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:17,135
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about hidden to bricks.

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,260
Rym: Bailing.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,418
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:29,800
Rym: So, uh, this is the kind of day where I might say warm today, but it's actually significantly less warm today compared to yesterday.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,060
Scott: Well, it's just 'cause it's raining.

10
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:34,820
Rym: Yeah, it looks like it's gonna rain pretty much constantly until, like, Monday.

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,946
Scott: Yeah, that's how things work.

12
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,096
Scott: You know, you have hot, hot, hot, storm, storm, storm.

13
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:40,040
Scott: Hot, hot, hot, storm.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,812
Scott: The hotness makes water go into the sky to make clouds.

15
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,440
Scott: That's how the weather works.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,775
Rym: The storm that went through last night was pretty fun, though, 'cause it just felt so much like those, like, really intense storms that I was used to as a kid.

17
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,360
Rym: that would happen on a semi-weekly basis living in a not-New York.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't that intense.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,167
Rym: It was more intense than the average New York City storm.

20
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,080
Rym: Usually, the storms here, at least until the last few years, were kind of just nothings.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,140
Scott: There's still, it's like, you know, I don't know about the, like, if you measure wind speed and, you know, rainfall, they might be considered intense.

22
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:17,336
Scott: But, like, if the thunder isn't so loud that you're like, "Oh, shit," right?

23
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:18,560
Scott: Or, uh...

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:18,962
Rym: I mean, it's hard.

25
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:19,846
Rym: I grew up in Michigan.

26
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,698
Rym: It's very hard for any storm to be so intense that I go, "Oh,

27
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:22,899
Rym: shit.".

28
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:25,119
Scott: I'm just saying, like, you know...

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,600
Rym: I've literally watched a tornado go down the street in front of my own house.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,194
Scott: If the thunder is just, like, rumble, rumble, rumble, it's, like, whatever, right?

31
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:33,641
Scott: I want it to be like... Right?

32
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,630
Scott: Like, everyone in the house jumps, like, "Oh,

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:35,931
Scott: shit.".

34
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,196
Scott: That's, you know, right?

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,380
Rym: I remember one time lightning struck the neighbor's house, and it was so loud in our house that we thought we got struck.

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,025
Scott: Yeah, and it, you know, it should be frequent, right?

37
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,209
Scott: It can't be a lot of these storms.

38
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:49,680
Scott: It's like, "Okay, maybe it'll be a couple booms that are loud," and then it's gone, right?

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,282
Scott: It's like, "No, no, no.

40
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:51,949
Scott: Hang around for a good half hour.

41
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:54,379
Scott: Like, just keep booming for a half hour, at

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:54,520
Scott: least.".

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,780
Rym: Actually, what these storms remind me of the most are the storms I was used to if I was further south or when I'm overseas in parts of Asia during monsoon season.

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,086
Rym: 'Cause they come in rapidly.

45
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,556
Rym: Heavy rain, and then they pass pretty quickly, too.

46
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:08,660
Rym: And that's a pattern that was...

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,966
Scott: Yeah, so it's like a tropical island.

48
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,417
Scott: Like, you'll be out on the beach, and be like, "Uh-oh, you see a storm coming,".

49
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,060
Scott: so you go inside.

50
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:15,400
Rym: I remember the first time we went to Alabama.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,399
Scott: Florida, the same thing happens.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,098
Rym: First time in my life as kids, we went to Alabama.

53
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,979
Scott: And then it goes away, and you go back outside.

54
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,780
Rym: Yup, on the way to Florida, and in both Alabama and Florida, I encountered something I just never experienced in my life, was it's sunny around noon-thirty, noon-forty-five.

55
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,997
Rym: Suddenly, there's driving rain you can't see for, like, five minutes, and then it's just sunny again.

56
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:34,760
Rym: Like, nothing happened.

57
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:43,580
Rym: But I was actually at the office, 'cause I go in a couple days a week, and all the phones went off.

58
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,248
Rym: It looks like it didn't get everyone's phones.

59
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,500
Rym: Like, people in Queens didn't seem like they got this alert.

60
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:51,760
Rym: Like, it seemed like it was targeted to people in Manhattan, but all the cell phones there went off.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,300
Rym: And New York State and New York City both have, like, these emergency notification systems, and there's the national systems and all that.

62
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:03,200
Rym: But there's different categories, like classes, of how important an alert is.

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:12,700
Rym: I'd never seen an extreme one before, and it was interesting that this was the time they used the extreme warning, as opposed to, like, the normal warning.

64
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:18,938
Rym: 'Cause the extreme warning basically said, "Yo, turn your AC down, or we're gonna have a power outage, like,

65
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:19,500
Rym: imminently.".

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,260
Scott: Yeah, there's not enough information about that, right, for me to say anything for certain.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,260
Scott: But things I do know, as I saw some reporting this morning, that A, it did have an effect.

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,140
Scott: Electricity usage went down a little bit after they made it, so I think they might have been A, seeing if it worked.

69
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:40,358
Scott: B, they might have detected, there might have been legitimate, they might have detected that power was going on.

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,680
Rym: There were a bunch of pretty big but localized outages all around the city around that time.

71
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,840
Rym: There was a big one in Williamsburg, they actually set up some cooling buses.

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,619
Rym: Like, there's buses idling with air conditioning, and they were passing out dry ice.

73
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:02,580
Scott: I also wonder if, you know, the last summer, right, everyone was, you know, inside, using their own personal air conditioners, and not at the office.

74
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,760
Scott: So, I was thinking, well, the office air conditioners are way more efficient, and if everyone goes to work, the home ones are off, which are less efficient.

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,600
Scott: That might have had an impact, but everyone was home last summer, but last summer wasn't as hot, so I don't know about that one.

76
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:26,540
Scott: But also, I do know that the old, shitty, but still somewhat safe, I guess, nuclear power plant was shut down very recently.

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,943
Rym: Which, there's a lot going on with that.

78
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:34,780
Rym: Shutting down Indian Point reduced the available power capacity for this entire region significantly.

79
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:38,720
Scott: And they replaced it with fossil fuel and non-renewable resources.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:50,360
Rym: I hate to say this, we almost would have been better off, well, no, we would have been better off if the plan hadn't been shut down Indian Point and do nothing, but the plan had been build a new nuclear power plant, and then shut down Indian Point.

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Scott: I don't know why the fuck they didn't just do that.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,340
Rym: Because America won't build nuclear power plants, because we're terrible.

83
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:54,802
Scott: Just do it.

84
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,739
Scott: Just building, you know, it's like you already have an Indian power plant there.

85
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,227
Rym: Actually, you want to know why we can't?

86
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,660
Rym: There's two reasons why we can't build nuclear power plants in America.

87
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,216
Rym: One, I hate to always say this, but it always comes back to this, it's the Republican Party's obstruction.

88
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:07,380
Rym: We can't change any regulations.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,107
Rym: This is New York.

90
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,400
Scott: New York could have built it itself.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,147
Rym: Nope, that's federal.

92
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,099
Rym: New York can't do that.

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,160
Scott: New York can't build a power plant?

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,367
Rym: Not a nuclear power plant.

95
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,340
Rym: Do you know how nuclear power plants are regulated?

96
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Scott: We're not allowed to build a nuclear power plant with our own New York money?

97
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:23,020
Rym: There's a lot of, there's 20ish years of planning.

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,840
Scott: Even if we've already got one, we can't replace one?

99
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:34,400
Rym: No, there are 20ish years of planning at the federal level to even get to the point of having a permit to build a new nuclear power plant.

100
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,039
Scott: Even though it's entirely within the borders of our state?

101
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,910
Rym: Yeah, no, it's federally regulated.

102
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,637
Rym: New York could just be building one.

103
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
Scott: Even though we're already importing radioactive fuel from somewhere?

104
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,820
Rym: Yeah, that's all federally regulated.

105
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,539
Scott: Yeah, but we're already getting fuel for the one we had.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,859
Rym: Well, actually, also, do you realize how little fuel they actually take?

107
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:57,731
Scott: Yeah, not much.

108
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:58,760
Scott: You don't have to get it that often.

109
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,862
Rym: Yeah, but it's done federally.

110
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:07,940
Rym: But two, more importantly, because of Republican obstruction, we can't update our processes, so we can't build modern plants or new things.

111
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:13,840
Scott: Why don't the nuclear power, how come the nuclear power companies aren't bribing as well as the fossil fuel power companies?

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,488
Rym: Because nuclear power doesn't make you any fucking money.

113
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,759
Rym: This needs to be fully run by the government.

114
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,333
Scott: You sell it for just as much as fossil fuel, and you don't have to buy it.

115
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,040
Scott: You don't need to buy a lot of fuel.

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:38,220
Rym: Nuclear power is better for the environment and better for pretty much all the practical things, but the cost of making it secure in dollars and making it safe and regulating it in dollars, that costs so much that you basically can't make money running nuclear power plants.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,800
Rym: The right way to do it would be to have the federal government run them.

118
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,180
Scott: What other countries do they want to have a bunch of nuclear power plants?

119
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:50,080
Rym: Well, really, there's a lot of solutions to this, Scott, but they're literally impossible because our government cannot change any laws right now.

120
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,878
Scott: Anyway.

121
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:06,820
Rym: Anyway, but the fact that because we couldn't make new power plants, we just replaced all of that capacity with fossil fuel, we actually drastically increased the amount of pollution that New York City generates by shutting down Indian Point without a nuclear alternative.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,293
Scott: But also, states are just ignoring federal law when it comes to weed, right?

123
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:12,819
Scott: Weed is still illegal federally.

124
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,224
Rym: That is not going to fly.

125
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:17,520
Rym: You can't ignore the law when you build a nuclear power plant.

126
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:18,525
Scott: Why not?

127
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:18,970
Scott: Just do it.

128
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:20,020
Scott: I feel like I dare you.

129
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:21,032
Scott: Okay.

130
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:21,194
Rym: Okay.

131
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:21,660
Rym: We got a mayor.

132
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,537
Scott: If I was governor of New York, you know I'd do it.

133
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,020
Rym: I feel like if you were the governor of New York, you would end up in jail for one thing or another.

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,546
Scott: Well, the cops would probably arrest me because of how much I fucked them over.

135
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,849
Scott: They'd find some excuse, right?

136
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,096
Scott: They would just be like, "You've done enough of this anti-cop guy.

137
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,459
Scott: Let's find some reason to arrest

138
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:39,540
Scott: him.".

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:39,940
Scott: There

140
00:07:39,980 --> 00:08:09,260
Rym: is another problem in America around this nuclear power thing that for a lot of reasons, a lot of leftists and a lot of even people who care about ecological issues tend to misunderstand nuclear power and be deeply opposed to it, which is part of why no politician will ever stake their tent posts next to the story of "I'm going to do more nuclear power," because that just kills your campaign because of honestly misguided resistance to nuclear power.

141
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:10,839
Scott: Too bad.

142
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:12,102
Rym: Too bad what?

143
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:18,660
Rym: There's no way to get someone elected who's for nuclear power because too many people on the left hate it and Republicans will oppose anything.

144
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,439
Scott: Just lie and then do it.

145
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,077
Rym: Ah, yes, but even then, you can't unless you change the laws and regulations and guess what that requires?

146
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:26,759
Rym: 60 senators.

147
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,740
Scott: Just do it anyway.

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,443
Rym: What do you mean?

149
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:28,986
Rym: do it anyway?

150
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:29,429
Rym: There's no.

151
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,033
Rym: just do it.

152
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,040
Rym: That is literally impossible.

153
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,793
Scott: Just do it.

154
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,461
Rym: All right.

155
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,607
Rym: What resources are you going to use?

156
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,120
Rym: New York State probably couldn't even afford to build a nuclear power plant.

157
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,279
Scott: Well, that's a different problem.

158
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,602
Rym: Yeah.

159
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,140
Rym: Who are you going to hire?

160
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,879
Scott: Tax the rich people of New York.

161
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,060
Rym: Yeah, I guess we can't do that for a lot of other reasons, too, because of Upstate.

162
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,639
Scott: Just do it anyway.

163
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,343
Rym: What do you mean?

164
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:47,706
Rym: do it anyway?

165
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:48,150
Rym: With what?

166
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,279
Rym: With a vote that we can't do?

167
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:52,280
Scott: No, just go to the rich people's house and take the fucking money.

168
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,179
Rym: Who specifically goes and does that?

169
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,853
Scott: Uh, I don't know.

170
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:04,900
Rym: Should Schumer and de Blasio just like show up at someone's house with Cuomo and just like take their wallet?

171
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,576
Scott: Yeah, I guess if I was governor of New York, I could just show up at a rich guy's house.

172
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,119
Scott: They'd let me in.

173
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,720
Scott: If I would.

174
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,691
Scott: And I'd be like, guess what?

175
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,218
Scott: This is stick up.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,252
Rym: You know, and you could Bill Murray that you're like you robbed them of all their cash and you leave.

177
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:20,160
Rym: and then who the fuck is going to believe them that this even happened?

178
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,240
Rym: You're saying.

179
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,259
Scott: I'd live stream it.

180
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,080
Rym: Sir, are you saying that Senator Rubin.

181
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,440
Scott: You know how many votes that would get me if you live streamed me, the governor.

182
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:29,500
Scott: Just imagine the hearing.

183
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,056
Scott: Governor Scott showing up at evil rich at like, I don't know who's the most evil rich person in New York.

184
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:34,458
Scott: Fuck it.

185
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:34,900
Scott: I don't know.

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,084
Scott: Dolan, right?

187
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,795
Scott: The guy who owns the garden, right?

188
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:38,440
Scott: Everyone hates him.

189
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,640
Scott: I show up at his house and I'd be like, yeah, we're taking this house and we're taking the Knicks and we're taking the rain.

190
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,181
Rym: No, no, no.

191
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:48,240
Rym: You slow roll it though and you do it by you just show up, you rob them and then no one believes them.

192
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:50,938
Scott: I know I live stream it.

193
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,979
Scott: You know how many votes I would get if I did that?

194
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,003
Rym: I don't know.

195
00:09:55,023 --> 00:10:00,260
Rym: There are a lot of, there are a lot of weird, angry white boys who would die to defend people like Elon Musk.

196
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,079
Scott: Well, Timothy Dolan is not Elon Musk.

197
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,461
Rym: Yeah.

198
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:08,680
Rym: I feel like he's got to have a bunch of fanboys that they're weirdly obsessed with the content of billionaires.

199
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,894
Scott: But also if he did live in New York, that would also make an amazing live stream.

200
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,180
Scott: just robbing him live.

201
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:15,420
Scott: Yeah, I'm here with the tax collector.

202
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,446
Scott: Plus all the rich people, right?

203
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:19,971
Scott: You know, it's like rob them.

204
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,460
Scott: It's like 100% of them have cheated on taxes.

205
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,620
Scott: I just have to find how they cheated on the tax, the state tax.

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,182
Scott: Oh yeah.

207
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:29,978
Rym: It's almost like the IRS should be going after rich people instead of poor people.

208
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:33,320
Scott: But again, I could be, I could just show up and be like tax collector, right?

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Scott: We're taking this Monet and we're taking this Golden Vase and we're taking this platinum toilet.

210
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,849
Rym: Oh, like Robin Hood style?

211
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,195
Rym: You're the evil sheriff.

212
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:44,520
Rym: Well, I guess the good sheriff in this case.

213
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,780
Rym: Just show up and demand a bag of silver to make you go away.

214
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,379
Scott: Take all the fart cars, sell them to other states and then set borders so they can't get in.

215
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,365
Rym: So there's a good segue.

216
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:56,100
Rym: Speaking of fart cars, uh, Scott's got some news here.

217
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,624
Scott: I do have some news.

218
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:02,280
Scott: So, uh, you know, this is only, you know, a little study, right?

219
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,240
Scott: Where they just sort of did, it was more of an experiment than I will say.

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,139
Rym: I have seen other studies for over a decade that say the same thing, but yeah.

221
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:20,100
Scott: So, you know, we complain about the fart cars, people taking their cars and removing catalytic converters and putting, taking off mufflers just cause they want to make noise.

222
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,367
Scott: That's their hobby, right?

223
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,460
Scott: Just making lots of loud noise for whatever reason.

224
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,820
Scott: But an old adage for motorcycle people has always been loud pipes save lives.

225
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,071
Scott: Now we all know the truth, right?

226
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,840
Scott: Even South Park got this one right.

227
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,702
Scott: Sorry, right?

228
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:38,280
Scott: That, uh, at least in some ways that episode has other issues.

229
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,519
Rym: Parts of that episode were not right, but anyway.

230
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,380
Scott: Yes, but the part that people who have loud motorcycles that are unnecessarily loud are just annoying.

231
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,399
Scott: Uh, and they're not cool, right?

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,086
Rym: They're also extremely polluting.

233
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:55,080
Rym: Like, yes, you might think, oh, well, it's more polluting without the catalytic converter.

234
00:11:55,461 --> 00:12:07,300
Rym: You have no, like they, especially if they're those bootleg motorcycles that actually have a two stroke engine, those things pollute more than like the hundreds and hundreds of miles of SUV driving for like a week's worth of driving.

235
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,703
Scott: Regardless, right?

236
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:19,580
Scott: Motorcycle people, you know, it is true that riding a motorcycle out on the road, uh, in the United States can often be quite dangerous and risky, riskier, you know, to, at least to yourself, right?

237
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,125
Scott: Not necessarily to others.

238
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:25,460
Scott: Um, and lots of people, you know, die even if they're wearing helmets and armor.

239
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:36,203
Scott: You know, I think, you know, a lot of people I know who are motorcycle people have, you know, significant number of them have fallen and gotten, you know, injuries that stay with them forever if they, if they survived.

240
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:36,484
Scott: Right.

241
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,050
Scott: So it is dangerous.

242
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,635
Scott: It shouldn't be a motorcycle.

243
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:43,671
Scott: inherently, you know, a two wheeled motorized vehicle, right?

244
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,020
Scott: Um, is way better than a car.

245
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,555
Scott: We'd be much better off if there was way more motorcycle and motorbike usage.

246
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,253
Scott: I don't want to, you know, denigrate the motorcycle, especially not an electric one, right?

247
00:12:54,293 --> 00:13:02,280
Scott: While an electric car won't save us electric, you know, bikes, motor, whether they're big enough to be called electric motorcycles or just e-bikes, right?

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,295
Scott: I don't know, whatever, you know, classification you want to, you know, make there.

249
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:07,580
Scott: Those are great.

250
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,773
Scott: Those are going to help our, if we use those more, that's going to be great for us.

251
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:20,332
Scott: But, uh, motorcycle people in the motorcycle culture have long a also enjoyed making lots of loud noises with combustion engines.

252
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:27,258
Scott: But unlike cars, they have this excuse that they've always used in the U S which is loud pipe, save lives.

253
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:34,466
Scott: The idea that, you know, you're going to put, you know, it's like if you honk a horn, that's not, you're not going to go honking a horn all the time.

254
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:34,948
Scott: Right?

255
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:46,112
Scott: So, but if your motorcycle makes loud noise with its pipe, you know, from, from, right, then everyone can, the logic, simple logic is that cars will hear you even if they can't see you.

256
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,914
Scott: because yeah, especially with all these fricking SUVs and trucks and shit, it's like you're way small, low to the ground.

257
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:53,500
Scott: They're way up off the ground.

258
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:54,202
Scott: Right?

259
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,860
Scott: It's like, you know, a lot of big tractor trailers and shit out on the highway.

260
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:02,218
Scott: It's like, yeah, you can't, a lot of times they don't see you, they change lanes and then you die.

261
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:02,640
Scott: Right?

262
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:08,583
Scott: Um, so being noticed would be a concern as a legitimate concern.

263
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:16,153
Scott: if you, if cars and other giant deadly vehicles did notice you, they don't want to, the drivers by and large don't want to hit you.

264
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,642
Scott: Um, so that would increase your safety.

265
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,730
Scott: So it's like get a motorcycle.

266
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:32,296
Scott: that's, you know, making a lot of loud noise with the pipe and supposedly common sense cars will notice you were there or at least they'll hear you that you're somewhere and they'll look around for you before they make a movement.

267
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:44,103
Rym: Now, nevermind the fact that I can, my anecdote is when I have driven and I hear a loud motorcycle, it's impossible to know where that motorcycle is because it's just when I hear it at all, it's just this diffuse noise that's coming from everywhere.

268
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:45,850
Scott: Well, but you start looking around for it.

269
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,020
Scott: You're not going to like shift lanes if you don't know, right?

270
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:56,127
Scott: You know, if you haven't seen or, you know, you still hear that noise coming from like somewhere and you're not going to just like shift lanes without looking and noticing.

271
00:14:56,268 --> 00:15:07,112
Rym: Every time I've ever heard it, cause I hear it a lot now when I drive up like to go hiking or camping on a weekend, uh, when I hear it, it appears instantly already passing me.

272
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:09,522
Scott: And that's what this study showed.

273
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:21,144
Scott: is that loud pipes, the old adage that seems like common sense, uh, actually is not true because the vast majority of cars and vehicles these days, right?

274
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,530
Scott: Are closed, right?

275
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,393
Scott: Especially on the highway.

276
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,718
Scott: You're not driving with the windows open.

277
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,550
Scott: You got air conditioning, even crappy cars have air conditioning.

278
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,920
Scott: Usually I guess if you got a convertible, right?

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,185
Scott: Maybe it'll it won't.

280
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:37,710
Scott: But then you have so much wind noise depending on the, well, I'm saying it's so I'm talking about, you know, how many people are driving convertibles, right?

281
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,449
Scott: The majority of cars on the road, vehicles on the road are have all the windows closed, right?

282
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,232
Scott: And modern cars are very, very good at blocking out outside noise.

283
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:53,508
Scott: You can hear the radio and the music and your GPS talking to you and other people in the car.

284
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,335
Scott: They're designed that way, right?

285
00:15:55,356 --> 00:16:01,280
Scott: To be as quiet as possible so that when you're driving, you don't hear shit outside unless it's like horn honking at you.

286
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:16,564
Scott: Like fancy cars even do stuff like if road noise increases, they automatically increase the very fancy sound system that will use active noise canceling to cancel out the engine noise of the car.

287
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:18,271
Scott: that is itself, right?

288
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,503
Scott: Its own engines that you don't hear your own engine when you're in your own car.

289
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,551
Scott: And that's really nice.

290
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:41,323
Scott: But the point is, is that the loud pipe won't save you because the majority of cars won't hear your pipe even a little bit until you are very close to them at which the point you've reached, you're already too late to be, you know, it's too late to be noticed, right?

291
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:43,933
Scott: You've already gotten too close to the car that you want to be hearing you.

292
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:47,588
Scott: So loud pipes don't, in fact, don't save lives.

293
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:56,823
Scott: They just harm lives by making people angry with loud noise, hurting your own hearing, polluting, being annoying, etc.

294
00:16:57,044 --> 00:17:06,142
Scott: There is basically no positive element to them other than the enjoyment that someone feels because they like them and they have one.

295
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:10,640
Scott: There is absolutely no other positive element to them that I can find.

296
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:25,500
Scott: And therefore I say that if I was governor of New York, governor, king of New York, you know, and legislator and everything, the rule would be if you have a loud motorcycle, we take it from you and we make it quiet.

297
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:29,234
Scott: And if you make it loud again, we take it from you and you don't give it back.

298
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,606
Scott: And if you ride another one, then we kick you out of the state.

299
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,153
Scott: You can't come back in.

300
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:38,191
Scott: And if you try to come back in, then we keep you in a jail.

301
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,943
Scott: I really want to abolish prison.

302
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,760
Scott: But if you're really going to go that far, okay, fine.

303
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:54,115
Rym: In my life, the people I've encountered or seen who say this adage, I am very confident that the majority of them don't actually believe it.

304
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:55,922
Rym: And it's just a thin excuse.

305
00:17:56,183 --> 00:18:03,960
Rym: they knowingly say it's like a talking point they just use to get people to stop criticizing their extremely loud should be illegal motorcycles.

306
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:14,417
Scott: Well, I think just, you know, in general, a lot of talking points, you know, and I can sort of see this because, you know, I guess in many ways everyone is victim to this.

307
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:14,758
Scott: Right.

308
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:18,092
Scott: And that there's some common sense thinking.

309
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,860
Scott: It just makes basic sense.

310
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,601
Scott: Right.

311
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:26,184
Rym: It's like it doesn't think about it at all because the sound you're moving forward quickly.

312
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:30,782
Scott: So the you're thinking, you know, the problem is, no, you saying thinking about it at all.

313
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,674
Scott: You've already begun thinking too hard about it.

314
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,405
Scott: The basic right is loud noise.

315
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:37,529
Scott: People notice it.

316
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,533
Scott: The basic thought.

317
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:38,774
Scott: Right.

318
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,602
Scott: Not going into any more thought.

319
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,875
Rym: But I don't think they've ever thought it protects me.

320
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,894
Rym: I think they've always thought it pisses people off and or gets them to look at me.

321
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,040
Rym: And that's my primary goal.

322
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:50,342
Scott: Right.

323
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:50,944
Scott: But sure.

324
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,349
Scott: But the point is there.

325
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,533
Scott: at the basic level, it makes common sense the same way that at only without looking into it.

326
00:18:58,594 --> 00:18:58,774
Scott: Right.

327
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:04,520
Scott: With only the basic level of thought, you think, well, crime is up, therefore we should get more cops.

328
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:14,560
Scott: It's the same basic thinking where you're not looking at data, investigating, checking nuance, checking details, just basic common sense thinking.

329
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:15,502
Scott: Right.

330
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:18,778
Scott: And you get things wrong when you only think that way.

331
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:19,140
Scott: Right.

332
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:27,695
Scott: But it's hard to convince someone that, you know, common sense is wrong because it is common sense when you only look at the surface.

333
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:28,700
Scott: It's just so obvious.

334
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:29,663
Scott: Right.

335
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,799
Scott: How could that possibly be wrong, even if it's extremely wrong?

336
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:41,088
Rym: So in some other news, New York City, we talked about this a little bit a while ago, like all these different ideas for new subway cars.

337
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:54,300
Rym: These were visible in a bunch of places in the city for a while, but apparently they did an official unveiling of the new R211 subway cars that it looks like they're going to replace the A train and the C train cars first.

338
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,067
Scott: Well, those are the oldest busted trains.

339
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,540
Rym: Those are the ones that still have like wood paneling on the inside.

340
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,809
Rym: Like they're they're really ugly.

341
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:02,672
Rym: They're really bad.

342
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,444
Scott: They're also the most delayed trains, I think.

343
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:07,953
Rym: And these new subway cars, aren't these the ones?

344
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:09,700
Scott: aren't these the new ones that have the?

345
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,146
Scott: they're like, you know, open, open.

346
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:13,536
Rym: So they're not going to make all the cars open.

347
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:25,704
Rym: So basically they're getting 500 of these things and 20 of them will have the open gangways, meaning it's one long car like start to end as opposed to separate individual cars that you're not allowed to walk between.

348
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:31,448
Rym: Now, studies show pretty much everywhere else on earth that the open gangways are just better.

349
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:36,669
Scott: They increase the capacity in which way in which they increase the capacity because you can ride in the in the gangway.

350
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:43,115
Rym: Not just that, but also because people diffuse and spread throughout the entire train instead of being stuck in the car they entered on.

351
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:46,027
Scott: So those will still spread throughout the entire train now.

352
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:46,871
Scott: Just not so much.

353
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,940
Scott: Only the people brave enough to go between the cars.

354
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,785
Rym: Very few people do that.

355
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:53,154
Rym: And most subway cars, they lock it these days.

356
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:54,780
Scott: I've never seen it locked.

357
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,005
Rym: It's locked all the time.

358
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,974
Scott: I've never seen it locked in between.

359
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:03,035
Rym: In fact, I have before Covid, I have oftentimes, especially on the seven or the four.

360
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,220
Scott: Are you sure you just don't know how to open it?

361
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:04,781
Rym: No, no.

362
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:09,760
Rym: I've seen people get in and then they can't get back in and they're like banging on the door until someone opens it for them.

363
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:11,423
Scott: Oh, yeah.

364
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,790
Scott: If you're in the middle part, that can happen.

365
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:14,540
Rym: You can't get into the next car because it's locked.

366
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,494
Rym: Sometimes you can force it open from the inside, but you can't force it open from the outside.

367
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:23,088
Rym: The point is also to take to their people to go out there.

368
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,016
Scott: Well, forget that.

369
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,462
Scott: People die going in the middle.

370
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:28,149
Scott: That's the.

371
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,580
Scott: that's the reason I don't do it because, yeah, people fucking die.

372
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,065
Scott: Not even exaggerating.

373
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:37,747
Scott: People have tried to go between the current train cars and it's not safe to go between them while the train is in motion.

374
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,578
Scott: And you can die if you mess up out there.

375
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:42,284
Rym: But it creates a ton more space.

376
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,212
Rym: And it also is like there are real studies.

377
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:47,224
Rym: People diffuse and spread out more evenly throughout trains.

378
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,160
Rym: when this is true compared to any other circumstance, like any other layout is the best.

379
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,533
Scott: Doesn't it also help the cooling of the train, like the heating and cooling?

380
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:55,658
Rym: It pretty much helps everything.

381
00:21:55,698 --> 00:22:00,940
Rym: The only argument anyone has ever made against these things is an argument only made by New Yorkers.

382
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:05,036
Rym: And it's that the entire train will have a problem.

383
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:11,742
Rym: if there's a problem on the train, as in a smelly person, a violent person.

384
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,196
Rym: Now it's a whole train problem instead of just.

385
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:16,943
Scott: Well, it's in one in some ways.

386
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:17,204
Scott: Yes.

387
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:18,048
Scott: In some ways, no.

388
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:18,329
Scott: Right.

389
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,189
Scott: Smell might come from one car to another, but it will go to the next car over and the next car.

390
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:23,369
Scott: Right.

391
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:23,952
Scott: You can get away.

392
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,940
Scott: And since it's open, you can get away.

393
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:26,301
Scott: Right.

394
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:29,755
Scott: If you get on a smelly car and the door closes behind you, you can escape.

395
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:30,317
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:36,602
Rym: I mean, but they're not making a lot of them yet, but they have the option to get a ton more of both the open gangway and the regular one.

397
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:44,494
Rym: So it seems like they're going to use the small number of the open gangway ones they got as an experiment and they'll decide what to do based on that.

398
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,911
Scott: I see this as just another one of those, you know, go sign situations.

399
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:49,152
Scott: Right.

400
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:50,075
Scott: People look at it.

401
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,244
Scott: They apply their common sense thinking.

402
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:52,726
Scott: Right.

403
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,472
Scott: And they don't like change.

404
00:22:54,914 --> 00:23:01,340
Scott: But then if you just make the change happen and ignore people who don't know better and then they'll get used to it and that'll be that.

405
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,621
Scott: Right.

406
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:02,605
Scott: It's like the end.

407
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:03,107
Rym: Yep.

408
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:03,649
Scott: Just do it.

409
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,484
Rym: The other cool thing is these trains have a lot less seating.

410
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:12,523
Rym: So more people are forced to stand, which you can cram a ton more people in.

411
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:20,095
Scott: But they you know, the only you know, I think, you know, right now we have seating and then we have priority seating for people with disabilities.

412
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:24,251
Scott: I feel like all seating should be priority seating people disabilities.

413
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,680
Scott: Well, the way they're doing it needs to be needs to be there.

414
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,343
Rym: There's a big section of disability seating in these new cars where the seats are flipped up by default.

415
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:33,327
Rym: So it's standing room.

416
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:37,604
Rym: But that's the place where also wheelchairs would go and the seats can flip down.

417
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,793
Rym: And they're only for people who need them.

418
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:40,616
Scott: Right.

419
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:42,424
Scott: I'm saying like we should eliminate all that.

420
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:50,459
Scott: We should have the amount of seating that is needed for, you know, the number of disabled people that are likely to be on train, according to what we figured out.

421
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:50,700
Scott: Right.

422
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,729
Scott: So that, you know, no disabled person has to stand.

423
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,134
Scott: But we shouldn't.

424
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:58,428
Scott: No abled person should be, you know, sitting.

425
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:58,971
Scott: Why?

426
00:23:59,031 --> 00:23:59,755
Scott: Why were you sitting?

427
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:00,840
Scott: if you're if you're able?

428
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:07,001
Rym: I mean, if there is a seat and I'm going like, I don't know, all the way out to Flushing or Rockaway, I'll sit down.

429
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:17,102
Rym: I mean, you know, it doesn't really matter if you're if you know what I really like to sit down if I'm taking the stupid E out to the train or to the airport, E to the air train.

430
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:19,109
Rym: I'll sit down on that if I can.

431
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:22,684
Rym: I usually can't because E train is always completely full in both directions all the time.

432
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:22,884
Scott: Right.

433
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:26,620
Scott: But if you're considering the design of the train, we want to increase capacity.

434
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,221
Scott: Right.

435
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:30,349
Rym: Well, we only need to increase capacity during the rush hours.

436
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:41,205
Rym: So, you know, one thing that absolutely if I if I had my way and there was an ethical way to do it, I would say that most seats in the entire system should be removed during rush hour.

437
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:42,008
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,835
Scott: Oh, you want temporarily remove it?

439
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,184
Scott: So one idea seems like unnecessary work.

440
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:47,249
Scott: Just remove them, period.

441
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:57,946
Rym: Well, one idea that they were floating a while back, I don't think they're going to do that here, is the idea that the four center cars on the most important subway lines would have no seats during the rush hours.

442
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,543
Scott: Wouldn't every?

443
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:11,246
Rym: every single station's entrance is so different that you can't design the cars around that.

444
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,053
Rym: I read there's an article about that specific idea.

445
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:15,663
Scott: Sure, but the center is going to be on average closer.

446
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:16,365
Scott: Right.

447
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:21,567
Scott: And therefore, you know, the person who needs the seat would travel less far.

448
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,916
Rym: No, that's that's apparently there is.

449
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:28,015
Rym: that's not true at all based on the just radically different configurations of all the subway stations.

450
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:29,039
Scott: They do every other car.

451
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:36,410
Rym: Well, the idea was you just make an area of dense pack, no seating in the center and everywhere else has seats.

452
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:38,319
Scott: Hmm.

453
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:42,873
Scott: If someone who needs a seat, they shouldn't have to go far.

454
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,263
Rym: But Scott, I'm saying there's no way to do that.

455
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:50,064
Rym: You realize how many stations, especially every other car, every other car wouldn't help in that way.

456
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:51,971
Scott: You're never more than one car away from a seat.

457
00:25:52,232 --> 00:25:52,775
Scott: That way you don't.

458
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:59,422
Scott: you're not going to have a situation where, you know, the station is at the front and the seats are in the middle and the person has to go.

459
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:03,859
Rym: Well, they couldn't do that because the no seat ones are also the gangway sections.

460
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:07,011
Rym: There will be trains where some sections are gangway and some sections are blocked off.

461
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:09,140
Scott: They can mix and match.

462
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,065
Scott: OK, for what reason?

463
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:11,467
Scott: I don't know.

464
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:13,959
Rym: Partly for all the reasons I described.

465
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,650
Rym: Part of this is to experiment on what actually works.

466
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:23,497
Rym: It's very difficult to model the behavior of subway riders because the system is so dense and all the stations are so different and unique.

467
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,699
Rym: You pretty much just have to experimentally see how people behave and then make changes based on that.

468
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:40,143
Rym: In some other news, I'm sure you saw the thing that bugs me the most about this story is that the reporting is still saying things like 16 dead, 150 unaccounted for.

469
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:42,353
Rym: This is one hundred and sixty three dead people.

470
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:43,357
Scott: Yes.

471
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:43,859
Scott: Yes, it is.

472
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:52,514
Rym: So an entire ass apartment building, well, condo building just collapsed and killed a ton of people in Florida.

473
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:57,196
Rym: And all the evidence points at this was just criminal negligence, as it always is.

474
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:04,687
Rym: And mostly the real culprit here seems to be Florida not regulating anything because it's a Republican state.

475
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,940
Rym: Like all the problems of America always seem to boil.

476
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,116
Rym: Like these are the kinds of problems that happen when you have such a broken country as this.

477
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:14,686
Rym: Our infrastructure is just going to get worse and worse and worse.

478
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:19,386
Rym: This is going to happen again soon, probably, like in the next five or ten years.

479
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:26,473
Scott: And while this is a huge, horrible disaster that I do not want to diminish in any way.

480
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:29,024
Rym: Half as many people were killed by guns in Chicago last weekend.

481
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:29,887
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:31,654
Scott: Everything that you said is just correct.

483
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,687
Scott: But how many people died in this building collapse?

484
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:37,277
Rym: One hundred and sixty three is the likely count.

485
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,040
Scott: Yeah.

486
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:43,643
Scott: Yesterday, two hundred and eighty three people died of covid in the United States alone.

487
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:44,225
Scott: Right.

488
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:51,212
Scott: So, you know, while it is it is one hundred percent true that our infrastructure is falling apart and will kill many more people.

489
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:52,016
Scott: Right.

490
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:59,506
Scott: It always bothers me the proportion of emphasis that is put on two different things.

491
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:00,068
Scott: Right.

492
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:00,971
Scott: By the media.

493
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:01,614
Scott: Right.

494
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:03,883
Scott: It's like, you know, one person is shot.

495
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:05,489
Scott: Huge news.

496
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:12,697
Scott: Like it's the end of the world in a town where, like, you know, at the same day, several people in the town could have died from, like, heart attacks.

497
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,408
Scott: And they're not like, what's causing the heart disease in the town?

498
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:16,031
Scott: Right.

499
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:17,577
Scott: It's not a story at all.

500
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:18,180
Scott: They don't even discuss it.

501
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,983
Scott: Well, those stories happen.

502
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:22,860
Rym: It's just people aren't that interested because they're used to that baseline amount of death.

503
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,642
Scott: Yeah.

504
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,446
Rym: Like look at mass shootings.

505
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,782
Rym: Mass shootings barely get reported on in America anymore because they're so common.

506
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:33,100
Rym: Literally, if less than 20 people die, it won't even make the news.

507
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:34,042
Scott: Right.

508
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:38,600
Scott: It's like we need the news to emphasize correctly.

509
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:42,457
Scott: And, you know, if the news is going to make its money by stoking fear.

510
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:43,040
Scott: Right.

511
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:47,175
Scott: Make the fear you stoke proportional to the reality.

512
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,761
Scott: There's plenty of things to be right.

513
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,970
Rym: I would argue that if you did that, you don't need to.

514
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:56,211
Rym: you would just make less money because more sensationalist outfits would just steal your entire audience.

515
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:57,958
Scott: You can you can just listen.

516
00:28:57,998 --> 00:28:59,324
Scott: There's plenty of things to be afraid of.

517
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,700
Scott: You can just sensationalize proportional to reality.

518
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:16,639
Rym: So I would argue that may not actually work because a lot of people, their ideology drives which media they consume and which causes they care about, not the media telling them what to care about, but they seek out the media that confirms what they already want to believe.

519
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,009
Scott: You know, but how do they get that way to begin with?

520
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:23,944
Rym: Well, that's a whole geek that's a whole GeekNights' a week.

521
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,791
Scott: I'm saying is I like to?

522
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,276
Scott: I like to change the maze.

523
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:28,340
Scott: You can't change the rat.

524
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,922
Scott: Change the me.

525
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:30,409
Rym: But here's here's what's going on here.

526
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:41,916
Rym: But part of the reason why things like this are should be newsworthy is that this a few hundred like this many people dying of heart disease is a much more complex, nuanced and widespread problem.

527
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:52,920
Rym: But this case was one hundred percent preventable by very minimal regulation like this, like it would not have taken much to prevent this from happening.

528
00:29:53,522 --> 00:30:06,840
Rym: and things like this keep happening because no one's willing to deal with the fundamental problem, which in this case basically is it is unethical to let towns, cities or even states have their own regulations for important things like infrastructure.

529
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,794
Rym: Why does Florida get to have different rules for buildings than New York?

530
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:16,760
Rym: They really shouldn't be allowed to because in almost all cases, conservative states just don't have rules and then people die.

531
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,484
Scott: I mean, it doesn't matter.

532
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:22,964
Scott: You know, I mean, it doesn't matter who makes the rules as long as you're forced to have good rules.

533
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:32,140
Rym: But it just so happens that good rules only come from progressive Democratic legislation and bad rules only come from Republican states.

534
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:46,135
Scott: Well, you know, maybe, you know, if states rights becomes the thing, right, maybe we'll end up in a situation where the, you know, the, you know, the standard of living in Democratic places becomes extremely high.

535
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:47,180
Rym: We're already there.

536
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,602
Scott: And right.

537
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,591
Scott: But I'm saying it becomes even more dramatic.

538
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,018
Scott: Right.

539
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,034
Rym: But there's some specific things that I want to flag for this story.

540
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,985
Rym: The thing you should really look at is how did this happen?

541
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:03,344
Rym: is specifically because now we don't know the details of exactly like why it collapsed.

542
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,870
Rym: There's going to be years investigations.

543
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:08,123
Rym: But this is one of the biggest residential disasters in American history.

544
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:11,476
Scott: But this kind of thing happens all the time in other countries.

545
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:12,059
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,330
Rym: Well, actually, it's not that common.

547
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:17,077
Scott: I've seen a lot.

548
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:21,434
Scott: My point is building collabs news in the United States is relatively rare.

549
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:22,540
Scott: When's the last time you've seen one?

550
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:22,781
Scott: Right.

551
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:24,849
Rym: But I feel like a few nuggets came out.

552
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:25,431
Rym: is that one?

553
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:26,917
Rym: there is a clear evidence.

554
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,644
Scott: you India building collapses.

555
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:31,977
Rym: There is clear evidence that this buildings had severe problems.

556
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:36,817
Rym: And obviously, like Florida didn't require this building to be inspected for 40 years.

557
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,993
Rym: But the big problem was that it was a condo.

558
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,065
Rym: So there was a condo association that managed the building.

559
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:45,692
Rym: Like people own these apartments.

560
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:46,535
Rym: Yep.

561
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:49,146
Rym: These repairs were known to that needed to be made.

562
00:31:49,648 --> 00:32:01,193
Rym: But the board of the condo could not get them made because they ended up being very expensive because the building was a piece of shit and the residents were fighting about not wanting to pay for the repairs.

563
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,165
Scott: People care about more about money than other things.

564
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:04,647
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,490
Scott: Is the fundamental?

566
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,880
Scott: is the fundamental problem underlying everything.

567
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,226
Rym: So as a result, you have a condo board that has to decide how to pay for the repairs of a building.

568
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,014
Rym: that is not a government.

569
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,885
Rym: This is like a private institution and the like.

570
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:21,374
Rym: the people voting in this are just the random ass.

571
00:32:21,394 --> 00:32:22,418
Rym: people who live in this building.

572
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:28,000
Scott: And many of them, they vote, they voted to some of them voted to die and they got their way.

573
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,361
Rym: Yeah.

574
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,373
Rym: A lot of people in this building may have voted to die.

575
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:33,060
Scott: They even voting to die.

576
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,647
Scott: You'd still don't deserve to die.

577
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,174
Scott: So it's still they don't deserve this.

578
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:37,560
Rym: I'm not I don't want to blame them.

579
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:42,800
Rym: I'm saying the failing of society was that they had the choice in the first place.

580
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,249
Rym: That is not the kind of thing that should be up for vote.

581
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,237
Scott: Are you pro democracy or anti democracy?

582
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:47,880
Rym: I am anti.

583
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,345
Scott: Make up your mind.

584
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,273
Rym: So in this case, look at the problem is what you.

585
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:54,326
Rym: this is the same reason why HOA's homeowners associations are such a problem.

586
00:32:54,728 --> 00:33:02,981
Rym: This is a body that is not a government, does not have the controls and protections that a government run democracy would have.

587
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:07,480
Rym: This is a private institution with its own rules that has to make life or death decisions.

588
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:15,611
Rym: You cannot put life or death decisions in the hands of unqualified people without government guidance, regulation and guardrails.

589
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:24,467
Scott: I think the problem is simply that you can't put life or death decisions in the hands of someone with an ulterior motive in this case, usually money.

590
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:26,596
Scott: And it's the same thing with even in the government.

591
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:29,628
Rym: Yeah, but it's worse than making life or death decisions.

592
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:32,278
Scott: who have this ulterior motive of the money.

593
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,150
Rym: The people live in this building, much like a homeowners association.

594
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:38,443
Rym: They vote and it's like you can vote and engage in your government.

595
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:39,929
Rym: But this was not a government.

596
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,435
Rym: So the condo board.

597
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:50,230
Scott: But the point is without the without the incentive of they're sitting there and they're doing like, you know, the old Lisa needs braces thing is like, you know, they're sitting there.

598
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,383
Scott: Well, fix my building or get a bunch of money.

599
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:53,765
Scott: Right.

600
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:59,026
Scott: It's like the only reason they didn't vote to repair the building is because it would mean spending money.

601
00:33:59,648 --> 00:33:59,829
Rym: Yes.

602
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:00,793
Rym: It was even worse than that.

603
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:07,960
Rym: The board, the condo board, the the governing body that makes all these decisions like an HOA is volunteer.

604
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,630
Rym: You've got to like actively be involved in this thing.

605
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:27,440
Rym: And most of the people on that board actually resigned in twenty nineteen and everything fell into disarray because of all the drama of this non-government entity requiring people to be active in it to do basic things like maintain a place that a bunch of people live together.

606
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,023
Scott: Sure, sure, sure.

607
00:34:29,063 --> 00:34:36,454
Scott: But if it wasn't for the money, even the disarrayed thing would have voted to repair because there wouldn't have been any reason not to.

608
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,117
Scott: Right.

609
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:39,043
Scott: It was greed that would make them.

610
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,775
Scott: the only reason that you wouldn't repair your building.

611
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:42,036
Scott: Right.

612
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,648
Scott: Is because you didn't care about money more than life.

613
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:56,838
Rym: But would they have in the sense that the voting is that the people who make these decisions are just the people with enough free time to volunteer to deal with the condo association of the building they happen to live in.

614
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,790
Scott: If there wasn't, you know, why did they vote no?

615
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:01,915
Scott: There was a. it wasn't.

616
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,686
Scott: you know, did they just do nothing?

617
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:05,650
Scott: They voted no.

618
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,794
Scott: We're not going to repair.

619
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,400
Scott: Why would you make that choice of no?

620
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:12,556
Rym: So the board, it's not clear because the building doesn't just vote.

621
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:13,962
Rym: The board members vote.

622
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:14,925
Rym: So right.

623
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:23,981
Rym: So imagine if in your building, whoever is busybody and like just bored enough to like go to these board meetings and deal with it without any compensation.

624
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:29,444
Scott: But even if you take a busybody, even if there's one busybody old lady and you go to the old lady and you say, "Old lady, you got two choices.

625
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:30,689
Scott: Repair the building.

626
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:32,316
Scott: Oh, yeah, the building needs repairs.

627
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:32,737
Scott: Okay.

628
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,506
Scott: Or but it's going to cost a bunch of money.

629
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:37,334
Scott: So or we can keep a bunch of money, right?

630
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:41,591
Scott: If that or money isn't there, even the busybody old lady is going to say, "Yeah, fix the

631
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:41,932
Scott: building."

632
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:42,575
Scott: Right?

633
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:43,077
Rym: Yep.

634
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:50,708
Rym: So it looked like the repair costs because the building had been so poorly maintained by the board for so long were just skyrocketing.

635
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:55,247
Rym: And it was going to cost like four times more than they'd even thought when they'd last got it assessed.

636
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:01,250
Rym: And basically the building was managed poorly by this volunteer board of busybodies for 40 years.

637
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:07,113
Rym: And people kept quitting the board because even before the repair costs because of drama.

638
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,700
Rym: No one wanted to deal with the drama.

639
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:12,460
Rym: And because it's not a government, no one was paid to deal with the drama.

640
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:26,932
Scott: I think the one thing that really stands out to me, actually, I don't know if this is a positive or not, is that it appears based on what we've learned that the level of just repair was so extreme, right?

641
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:34,844
Scott: The fact that it took this long for it to collapse actually speaks to the original quality of the building, right?

642
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:38,920
Scott: In that you had to really, really go hard on the not repair.

643
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,364
Rym: Modern construction.

644
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:51,892
Rym: And by modern, I say like after the early 70s that those nothing can short of a weird disaster or extreme negligence that exposes the rebar inside of concrete.

645
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:55,848
Rym: It's almost impossible to have a building constructed with these methods collapse.

646
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:56,973
Scott: Right.

647
00:36:56,993 --> 00:37:02,092
Scott: So the point that I'm trying to make though is if anyone's afraid of their building falling down, right?

648
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:09,220
Scott: Unless you are specifically aware of like, you know, some obvious damage along these lines.

649
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,891
Rym: If I lived in Florida in a building that was built more than 20 years ago, I'd probably be afraid and want inspections immediately.

650
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,096
Scott: I'm just saying.

651
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:27,775
Scott: But if you know, if you don't go in the basement and see like a bunch of leaks and cracks and all sorts of really obvious damage, you know, and things of that nature, it's probably OK.

652
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:28,318
Scott: Yeah.

653
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,547
Rym: Oh, here's a sad money line.

654
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,462
Rym: In April, the residents were up.

655
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:49,020
Rym: Dozens of residents of the building signed a letter questioning the need for repairs and demanding a lower assessment of the price of the repairs because it would have doubled the maintenance dues they currently pay to do any of these repairs.

656
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,849
Scott: People just care more about money than human life.

657
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,083
Scott: That is the fundamental problem of even their own lives.

658
00:37:55,445 --> 00:38:00,481
Scott: Every single, every single thing, every single problem we have everywhere is because of that thing right there.

659
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,990
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

660
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,114
Rym: So check this out.

661
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:12,021
Rym: Emily and I hike a lot.

662
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,210
Rym: That was one of the things we could do during the lockdowns.

663
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,413
Rym: And we're keeping it up.

664
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:20,134
Rym: And now we're going to start camping and doing a lot more like long trip, long distance backpacking and everything.

665
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:28,347
Rym: If you've ever wanted to get into this kind of stuff, like I have a background of like Cub Scouts and like I camped a lot as a kid, so I had a good understanding of the basics.

666
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,536
Rym: But of course, technology changed.

667
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:31,500
Rym: Things got better.

668
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:37,242
Rym: Some conventional wisdom that might have seemed common sense 20 years ago when I was doing this.

669
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,792
Rym: Not true under modern scrutiny.

670
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:41,278
Rym: So things change.

671
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:42,523
Rym: So I'm doing my research, too.

672
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:51,298
Rym: But if you want to get into backpacking and camping, REI, their YouTube channel is actually an A plus resource.

673
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,186
Rym: These videos are super accurate.

674
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,210
Scott: They're trying to sell you shit.

675
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,893
Scott: They don't want you to.

676
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:55,738
Scott: they want you to die.

677
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:57,346
Scott: They want you to survive on your camping trip.

678
00:38:57,386 --> 00:38:58,291
Scott: Come back and buy more shit.

679
00:38:58,311 --> 00:38:58,512
Scott: Yeah.

680
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:02,409
Rym: But also, REI is a company I respect because REI is a co-op.

681
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:04,253
Rym: That's true.

682
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:05,017
Rym: Like I'm a member.

683
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:09,658
Rym: REI is actually like one of the few ethical large companies out there.

684
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:12,549
Rym: I say ethical with a little bit of quote because it's very hard.

685
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,513
Scott: It's not that large.

686
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:15,460
Rym: They're a pretty large company.

687
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:16,906
Rym: I don't know what their market cap is.

688
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:20,541
Scott: It's not small, but it's not like, you know, large.

689
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:21,625
Rym: I'd say they're fairly large.

690
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:26,305
Scott: At least it's way better than at least it's better than EMS that it replaced.

691
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:35,843
Rym: Well, anyway, so in their channel, they have a sub, like a thread, like one of the people who hosts videos, Miranda in the Wild.

692
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:37,791
Rym: That is the series to watch.

693
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:48,515
Rym: This woman just talks about with a high degree of skill and knowledge and demonstrations all the different things you need to know about backcountry, camping and hiking and everything.

694
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:50,001
Rym: And it's just fantastic.

695
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,050
Rym: Like it's also utter entertainment.

696
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,174
Rym: Like it's a great channel.

697
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:53,937
Rym: I highly recommend it.

698
00:39:54,218 --> 00:40:08,194
Rym: The one I'm going to link to is every modern way to filter water when you're out in the wild to then safely drink it because that stuff has progressed a lot since the last time I drank water from a stream in the wild.

699
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:11,870
Rym: And let me tell you, I'm never using iodine or bleach again.

700
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:16,038
Rym: I'm never doing the boiling method again unless it's an emergency situation.

701
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:18,003
Rym: Modern stuff is so much better.

702
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:19,531
Rym: These pumps are fantastic.

703
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,560
Scott: Cool.

704
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,525
Rym: So what do you got?

705
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,501
Scott: So, you know, usually when you're playing, usually a D&D or something, right?

706
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:31,660
Scott: Or if you're into fantasy worlds and things of that nature, you know, medieval type stuff.

707
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,928
Scott: You know, what's something that comes up often?

708
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,353
Scott: Like the different jobs, right?

709
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:40,532
Scott: You know, you think about blacksmiths the most, of course, but also tavern keepers, right?

710
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:44,748
Scott: You know, and heralds, heralds are a big one.

711
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:49,688
Scott: You know, and you know, you think about these old timey jobs from the olden days, right?

712
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,998
Scott: Because you're going to be encountering those people on your way.

713
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,459
Scott: You know, the ones I like to think of a lot are the coffin maker, right?

714
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,390
Scott: The cooper, right?

715
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:05,833
Scott: But one that I didn't think about really pretty much at all is the farrier, right?

716
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:10,980
Scott: A farrier and Rym nose from clipping bunny toes.

717
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,846
Scott: A farrier is someone whose entire job is just clipping horse toes and horseshoes and related to only horse feet.

718
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:19,629
Scott: That's their whole job.

719
00:41:19,669 --> 00:41:20,512
Scott: Horse feet only.

720
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,805
Rym: Horse feet are real important to horses and the people who interact with them.

721
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:29,046
Scott: Imagine being a horse and having a foot problem and there's no, and it's like you're just on wild horse.

722
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:31,115
Scott: That's not a good time, right?

723
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:37,200
Scott: You're really, you know, you have this really a symbiotic relationship with a human whose entire job is to handle horse feet.

724
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,943
Scott: That's a good time.

725
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:50,211
Scott: So I had never gave a thought about farriers in my whole life, but thanks to the YouTube algorithm, as soon as you watch one video of farriering, right?

726
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:53,103
Scott: You're going down that well and you're seeing all kinds of stuff.

727
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:57,140
Scott: So just because one person happened to link to one farrier video.

728
00:41:57,301 --> 00:42:01,760
Scott: Now you're seeing all kinds of, you know, horse hooving in all kinds of nonsense.

729
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:14,589
Rym: I'm just thinking there was a time, this is not true anymore, but there was a time when YouTube updated their recommendation algorithm where you type in a word and it recommends words to look for where.

730
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:22,640
Rym: if anyone, at least in like America, typed the word horses and hit space into YouTube, what would be recommended?

731
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:30,349
Rym: The rest of that phrase for anyone was, and I'm quoting here, mating up close for a long time.

732
00:42:31,976 --> 00:42:34,567
Rym: That was the recommendation that was showing up for a while.

733
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:35,932
Rym: It is not true anymore.

734
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:36,716
Rym: Anyway.

735
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:38,443
Scott: Well, that's good.

736
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:39,146
Scott: So yeah, I didn't know.

737
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,893
Scott: I didn't know jack shit about horse shoes.

738
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:43,423
Scott: Other than that, you know, you generally want to protect the horse's foot.

739
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:45,029
Scott: That's why they put a horseshoe on there.

740
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:45,491
Scott: Right.

741
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:46,355
Scott: And they nail it through.

742
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:52,800
Rym: the, you know, especially depends on what kind of like work the horse is doing and where the horse, what the fuck do I know about horseshoes?

743
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,381
Scott: Nothing.

744
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:53,542
Scott: Right.

745
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:54,546
Scott: Well, what do I know now?

746
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:55,691
Scott: Slightly more than nothing.

747
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:59,124
Scott: And I'm going to link to you the best horseshoeing video that I saw.

748
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:02,600
Scott: And it's a horse that's got, you know, some foot problems.

749
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:03,181
Scott: Right.

750
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:04,687
Scott: And there's sort of obvious foot problems.

751
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:08,141
Scott: Even if you're not a farrier, you can just see something ain't right with the horse's foot.

752
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:08,783
Scott: It needs some help.

753
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:09,065
Scott: Right.

754
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:12,800
Scott: So, you know, they give it a little toenail clipping, which is a Rym.

755
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,519
Scott: You should, you know, after you're watching this, you're going to be like, man, bunny toenail clippings, easy peasy.

756
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:21,832
Scott: You know, that's not someone's entire career.

757
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:26,610
Rym: My trip with the difficulty of bunny toe clipping the nails is that they're fragile little guys.

758
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:29,803
Rym: So you can't you got you can't just manhandle them like you can.

759
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:31,309
Scott: They go they go for the horse's foot.

760
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,996
Scott: They're going with like big old files.

761
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:33,176
Scott: Yeah.

762
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:36,349
Rym: Like when I call the dog sales, you just like pull out a dremel and hold the dog.

763
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:36,529
Rym: Yeah.

764
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:37,433
Scott: Yeah.

765
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:41,870
Scott: The tools they got, it's like they look like they're ready to go into like a, you know, a machine shop.

766
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,854
Scott: Yeah, it's like things.

767
00:43:43,718 --> 00:43:50,162
Scott: But yeah, they do something really cool in this video, which is quite ingenious and was probably not possible until relatively recently.

768
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:54,420
Scott: You know, they trim the horses, you know, they get the foot as nice as they can.

769
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:58,756
Scott: They apply some nice, you know, medicine, I guess, horse Neosporin or whatever the equivalent is.

770
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:02,250
Scott: And then, you know, you can't really put a bandaid on a horse foot.

771
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:02,552
Scott: Right.

772
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:05,847
Scott: So what they do is they use a mold and some, you know, resin.

773
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:06,489
Scott: Right.

774
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:15,765
Scott: And they squirt, they inject it into the mold and they basically create like a like an artificial like horse hoof around, you know, the real hoof.

775
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:16,508
Scott: Right.

776
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,235
Scott: And then they put a shoe on that.

777
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:18,898
Scott: It's neat.

778
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:19,340
Scott: And it's like.

779
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:21,145
Scott: it's like, damn, I want to.

780
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:25,284
Scott: I want to do that to my foot without the nails, not the nail part, but the other parts.

781
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:28,740
Scott: It's like, I guess, without the filing off my foot part also.

782
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:31,128
Rym: I did lose a toenail.

783
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,012
Scott: Yeah, there is.

784
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:39,880
Scott: If you like this video, just by watching this video, get ready for YouTube to send you down the whole of horse pedicures.

785
00:44:42,101 --> 00:44:42,985
Rym: The recommendations.

786
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:43,767
Rym: It's already there.

787
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:45,313
Scott: It's already there.

788
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:45,996
Scott: It's going to be.

789
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:58,104
Scott: There's a whole like, you know, you know, YouTube horse pedicure world of farriers and their works to explore, even though I'll probably, you know, maybe I'm going to ride a horse in the rest of my life.

790
00:44:58,466 --> 00:45:00,775
Rym: Oh, we went riding actually not too long before Covid.

791
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:03,265
Rym: We went out to a wedding upstate and we went trail riding.

792
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:05,795
Rym: I hadn't ridden a horse in like more than a decade.

793
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:10,533
Scott: And it's unlikely I will ride a horse more than a handful of times in the rest of my life.

794
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:11,578
Rym: I would like to get into.

795
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:20,851
Scott: I'll probably watch more farrier videos in my life in the rest of my life than I will ride actual and I will likely never shoe a horse in my life.

796
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:28,943
Rym: So so I will just point out I looked up to be sure REI, which was founded in the 30s, is a. they make three billion dollars a year.

797
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:29,726
Rym: They're huge.

798
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:31,936
Scott: So that's that's not huge.

799
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:33,482
Rym: I mean, it's huge up to the.

800
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:34,486
Rym: it's not a megacorp.

801
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:35,390
Rym: It's not an Amazon.

802
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:47,657
Rym: Anyway, anyway, in the meta moment, we're going to be live at PAX Online East 2021 on July 17th, which is coming up with Atari game design at one forty five p.m.

803
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,785
Rym: on the PAX two twitch stream.

804
00:45:50,106 --> 00:45:55,023
Rym: We will not be live at PAX West because it is way too soon to have a convention.

805
00:45:55,043 --> 00:46:05,361
Rym: And with all these masking and social distancing and capacity limitations, it's going to be the first PAX we've not attended since we started attending them in 2008.

806
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:05,964
Scott: I'm OK with that.

807
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:06,285
Scott: Yeah.

808
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:07,791
Rym: I hate to break that streak.

809
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:12,591
Rym: I felt good to have that streak going for so long, but just an arbitrary streak, just some arbitrary thing, whatever.

810
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:16,367
Rym: But I would like to be able to go to PAX, but it just seems like it's too soon.

811
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,700
Scott: If they're when they're you know, it's like if you think.

812
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,331
Scott: if they I said this before, I'm going to say keep saying it.

813
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:32,797
Scott: If they think the PAX itself is not safe enough to hold in a normal fashion, you know, if you're going to hold it, of course, you need those safety precautions if you insist on holding it.

814
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:40,523
Scott: But if you don't think it's safe enough to hold without those precautions, I will simply take the even safer route of not going.

815
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:42,531
Rym: If you need the precautions, it's too soon.

816
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,580
Rym: And that's how we're going to treat all conventions.

817
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,633
Rym: So hope cautiously optimistic for PAX Unplugged.

818
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:52,932
Rym: But if they require masks and rules, we're out, which will be sad, but we'll see.

819
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:55,765
Rym: We're still reading the Tale of Genji.

820
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:56,911
Rym: I've been reading it.

821
00:46:57,796 --> 00:46:58,520
Scott: I read it recently.

822
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:03,555
Rym: Partly because the weather's not been great lately, so I have more time indoors.

823
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:04,600
Scott: It's going to rain a lot this week.

824
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,825
Scott: It's going to rain for like a week.

825
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:07,894
Rym: Might be clear on Sunday.

826
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:09,460
Rym: Somewhat clear on Sunday.

827
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:09,921
Rym: Maybe.

828
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:10,323
Rym: We'll see.

829
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:11,488
Scott: Monday's the day.

830
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:12,713
Rym: Monday will be the biking day.

831
00:47:13,054 --> 00:47:13,677
Rym: Maybe the beach day.

832
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:13,998
Rym: We'll see.

833
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,167
Rym: Anyway, so we're reading the Tale of Genji.

834
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:24,779
Rym: Genji continues to just kind of just close his eyes and squint at things and not worry too much and just split through life.

835
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,484
Rym: Causing problems.

836
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:27,248
Rym: Reminds me a lot.

837
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,917
Rym: Solving problems sometimes.

838
00:47:28,997 --> 00:47:31,849
Rym: Mostly just causing problems and not noticing he's caused them.

839
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:34,058
Scott: What's the one?

840
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:35,423
Scott: The Rothfuss one?

841
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,290
Rym: Oh, the Kingkiller Chronicle.

842
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:39,438
Scott: It reminds me a little bit of that.

843
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:40,182
Rym: I can see that.

844
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:43,278
Scott: I gotta say, there's a little bit of commonality.

845
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:43,620
Scott: Yeah.

846
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,567
Scott: Only without the fantasy magic part, obviously.

847
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:47,853
Rym: I do feel a little bit.

848
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:53,134
Rym: the, you know, the path of least resistance is the path of least resistance.

849
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:58,697
Rym: So it's hard to fault Genji for following that path most of the time.

850
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,056
Rym: But well, we'll talk about it when we talk about the book, but we're reading it and you should read it too.

851
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:06,869
Rym: It's the first goddamn novel ever.

852
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,291
Rym: Yep.

853
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:08,899
Rym: There were novels before that.

854
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:11,245
Rym: So, uh, Balan.

855
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,853
Scott: Mm hmm.

856
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:17,666
Rym: I mean, I'm going to put I'm going to put the closing music there and then we'll come back to the show.

857
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,233
Rym: This has been Ignite with Rym and Scott.

858
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:21,442
Rym: It's moderately funny.

859
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,412
Rym: I think the listener will find that a little bit funny.

860
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:23,834
Rym: All right.

861
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,249
Scott: So Rym just told me the joke he inserted into this.

862
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,715
Scott: I don't think it's that funny.

863
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:31,749
Rym: If you think that joke was funny at all, tweet.

864
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:34,040
Rym: I'll tell him that that joke was funny.

865
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:35,622
Scott: Sure.

866
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,173
Scott: So basically earlier in life.

867
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:38,715
Scott: Right.

868
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:40,884
Scott: I was we weren't wise in our ways.

869
00:48:40,904 --> 00:48:56,906
Scott: And there were often be situations where, like, you know, you start doing something and due to social pressure or custom or psychology or whatever have you, you sort of feel like, you know, you don't even consider escaping.

870
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,312
Scott: It's like you're in and you're in.

871
00:48:58,372 --> 00:48:59,817
Scott: It's like, I guess I'm doing this now.

872
00:48:59,878 --> 00:49:00,018
Scott: Right.

873
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:01,424
Scott: You're not even like thinking about it.

874
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:02,348
Scott: You're just sort of not.

875
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,337
Scott: you're just doing the thing you set out to do.

876
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:04,457
Scott: Right.

877
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:12,989
Scott: For example, when we went to New York City to go see Shigeru Miyamoto, we waited in line at the Nintendo store half the day.

878
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,636
Scott: We didn't see him.

879
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:15,419
Scott: And then we went home.

880
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,282
Scott: Right.

881
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:18,794
Scott: Well, there was a GeekNights episode about that, I think.

882
00:49:18,854 --> 00:49:19,980
Rym: God, that was a long time ago.

883
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:21,742
Scott: We could have.

884
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:27,446
Scott: And it would have been wiser for us to realize the truth, which is that so many people were cutting in line in front of us.

885
00:49:27,908 --> 00:49:29,013
Scott: We were waiting so long.

886
00:49:29,073 --> 00:49:30,037
Scott: They weren't letting us in.

887
00:49:30,057 --> 00:49:31,323
Scott: There was so little information.

888
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,314
Scott: You know, there was going to be a strict limit on the whole thing.

889
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:37,125
Scott: It was easy to see that we were never going to get in those doors.

890
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,491
Scott: We were not close enough to the front.

891
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:47,143
Scott: And we would have been able to save time in our lives by simply getting out of that line and going home hours earlier and not wasting a day.

892
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:48,529
Scott: We could have gone and done something else.

893
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:56,439
Rym: My moment growing up like I like I had a thing and I think this is a sentiment a lot of people seem to have of if I start reading a book, I'm going to finish it.

894
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:02,545
Rym: And I remember as a kid for the first time, I started reading a book and I got like the deep way into it.

895
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:08,007
Rym: And then I made the conscious decision to not read the rest of it because that book sucked.

896
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:13,851
Rym: And that was like a moderate revelation for me that, oh, I can't I could just stop.

897
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,940
Rym: I don't have to follow through on something that sucks.

898
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:24,051
Scott: Right now, it's a little tricky because I sort of also have the opposite problem, right, which is something I really do honestly want to finish.

899
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:24,372
Scott: Right.

900
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:26,320
Scott: You're working on a thing you want to work on.

901
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,794
Scott: You know, maybe some podcast or maybe, you know, maybe you're making something right.

902
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:32,485
Scott: You want to do this and you just can't finish it.

903
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:32,806
Scott: Right.

904
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,898
Scott: So it's like and it's you can't even get yourself to work on it.

905
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:37,203
Scott: It's like the opposite problem.

906
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:37,344
Scott: Right.

907
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:37,926
Scott: You can't get in.

908
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:41,240
Scott: You want to get over the finish line, but you can't finish.

909
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:49,875
Scott: So because you have that problem when you're in a situation where you're headed towards the finish line and it's like you don't want to bail.

910
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:50,437
Scott: Right.

911
00:50:50,457 --> 00:50:51,661
Scott: You sort of can get the mix.

912
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:57,284
Scott: You really have to evaluate is that, you know, look at what you're in for.

913
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:57,846
Scott: Right.

914
00:50:57,946 --> 00:50:58,649
Scott: Are you stuck?

915
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:00,857
Scott: Are you staying just because you think you have to stay?

916
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:02,042
Scott: Are you enjoying yourself?

917
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:03,287
Scott: Is this really what you want?

918
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:09,751
Scott: And, you know, be able to strongly commit or quit as soon as possible.

919
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,196
Scott: That's that's the longer you go.

920
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:12,541
Rym: You got to make that decision.

921
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:13,325
Scott: And it's really not.

922
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:16,540
Rym: it's not easy because otherwise you fall in the sunk cost fallacy.

923
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:19,391
Rym: Like, well, I've been standing here for four hours.

924
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:24,089
Rym: I might as well stick around because there's a chance that Miyamoto is going to sign myself a two cartridge.

925
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:27,944
Rym: But the reality was the chance was so low.

926
00:51:28,848 --> 00:51:36,177
Rym: If you and the longer you wait before you bail, the more cost you have paid in time or money or energy or something.

927
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,125
Rym: And the outcome was the same.

928
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:41,620
Rym: So if there's even a chance you're going to bail on something, you've got to make that decision.

929
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,863
Rym: ASAP.

930
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:44,148
Scott: Yeah.

931
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:49,650
Scott: The sooner you bail, if bailing was the right choice, the sooner you bail, the better off you are.

932
00:51:49,831 --> 00:51:50,052
Scott: Right.

933
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:53,686
Scott: If you wait 10 more minutes and then bail, well, you just lost those 10 minutes.

934
00:51:53,787 --> 00:51:54,068
Scott: Right.

935
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:56,600
Scott: You could have just decided the same thing earlier.

936
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,754
Rym: Now, I remember RIT because this problem happened a lot.

937
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:07,300
Rym: Like, I'm not going to try to get into all the different anecdotes, but where we would decide to do something as a group, it kind of sucked.

938
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:09,409
Rym: Or like one person really wanted to do something.

939
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,955
Rym: The rest of us weren't super into it.

940
00:52:11,156 --> 00:52:12,120
Rym: We go along with it anyway.

941
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:13,465
Rym: It's actually not great.

942
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,368
Rym: We all stick around.

943
00:52:14,388 --> 00:52:17,400
Rym: And there was an episode, I guess, South Park came up again.

944
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,094
Rym: The trifecta will come when it comes up a third time around that time.

945
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:27,561
Rym: And when we used to be watching South Park, an episode dropped the return of the Fellowship of the Ring of the Two Towers or whatever.

946
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:32,942
Rym: And in that episode, a character has a moment where he learns the truth about his situation.

947
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:36,999
Rym: He walks out and he makes his hand gesture and he's just like, I'm out.

948
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:38,985
Rym: And they're like, what?

949
00:52:39,065 --> 00:52:40,130
Rym: And he's just like, I'm out.

950
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,059
Rym: And then he leaves and that's it.

951
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:49,304
Rym: And at RIT, Scott and I very consciously made the decision to make that a thing in our group.

952
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:54,646
Rym: We started to, whenever we had two things, we'd either bail by saying, I'm out.

953
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:55,549
Rym: Like, we're done.

954
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:56,192
Rym: This is over.

955
00:52:56,894 --> 00:52:58,299
Rym: Or it's all you.

956
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:08,400
Rym: Where if we chose not to bail, whoever was the person who was advocating for not bailing, it's all you means you are now responsible for any misery that follows.

957
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:13,860
Rym: But if you are correct and our instinct to bail was wrong, you get all the glory.

958
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,290
Rym: You were the one who got us this experience.

959
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:19,462
Rym: I don't think anyone ever was the.

960
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,166
Rym: it's all you.

961
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:22,319
Rym: And it was good for them in the long run.

962
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,451
Scott: You're usually the all you.

963
00:53:25,793 --> 00:53:26,599
Scott: It's usually all you.

964
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:26,961
Rym: Yeah.

965
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:29,919
Rym: And a lot of the things that we tried to do did not work out so great.

966
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:38,145
Rym: But we became like especially like I have a very well-known among my friends.

967
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:41,860
Rym: My bail tolerance is like a hair trigger.

968
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:46,360
Rym: Like, you know, I'm walking to a Starbucks and there's more than one person in line.

969
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,343
Rym: I just walk right back out.

970
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:51,940
Scott: Your bail tolerance has gone to the extreme in the other direction.

971
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,643
Scott: A little too far.

972
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,250
Scott: You got to bring it back.

973
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:56,500
Scott: You know, it's like they'll be sick.

974
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:02,580
Scott: It's like, yeah, if I'm going to a restaurant and it's way full and there's people just packed out front, it's like, OK, we're not waiting to eat here.

975
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,082
Scott: Right.

976
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:06,399
Scott: But there'll be a place with like, you know, it's full.

977
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,614
Scott: There's like one group waiting in front of us and we'll be like bail.

978
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:10,880
Scott: And I'm like, there's one group.

979
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,854
Scott: We're going to be sitting in like 15, 20 hours.

980
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,330
Rym: But I've been in situations where that delicious food is here.

981
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:18,640
Scott: It's going to be what I've been in situations in front of us.

982
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:28,160
Rym: Like, fuck you, Sukkotai, where there was an open table and they told us 15 minutes multiple times over the course of an hour and did not give us a table.

983
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:28,761
Scott: Right.

984
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:34,800
Scott: But at that point, it's like, yeah, if I see the open table and then I wait 10 minutes and if they don't give it to me when I ask, then I bail.

985
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,140
Scott: Right.

986
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,867
Scott: But you're you're at the point where you're bailing.

987
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,440
Scott: Like you walk in, you'll take you'll like take a snapshot of the scene and then leave.

988
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,958
Rym: It's like, give it 30 seconds.

989
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,230
Rym: I think part of what part of what happened there is.

990
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:46,000
Rym: I do this particularly with restaurants.

991
00:54:46,561 --> 00:55:02,160
Rym: And I think it's an artifact of living in New York, especially in a neighborhood full of great restaurants for so long, that if there is even the slightest bit of resistance walking into a restaurant that I like, there are 10 other restaurants I like just as much within a 15 second walk of that door.

992
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:09,420
Scott: I think another problem is that with restaurants specifically, right, if you are currently looking for a restaurant, you are hungry.

993
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:09,740
Rym: Yup.

994
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,980
Rym: And hungry is just a few minutes away from hangry.

995
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:14,484
Scott: That's right.

996
00:55:14,504 --> 00:55:17,800
Scott: So you're less tolerant of waiting in that situation.

997
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:21,911
Rym: If I'm hungry, I will go from let's eat at this restaurant to.

998
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,020
Rym: I'm just going to buy four Gatorades from this deli.

999
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,564
Rym: And that is my dinner.

1000
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:32,840
Rym: I will bail two Gatorades and stickers like faster than I will wait an hour to sit down at a restaurant.

1001
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:33,764
Rym: Right.

1002
00:55:33,784 --> 00:55:33,986
Scott: Right.

1003
00:55:34,006 --> 00:55:35,800
Scott: So don't bail that as much as Rym is bailing.

1004
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:43,360
Scott: But there are plenty of situations, you know, most notably, I think, is, you know, the tabletop game is the one we bring up all the time.

1005
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:44,002
Scott: Right.

1006
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:50,940
Scott: You if you're playing a tabletop game with people, you sort of have this obligation that like you're not supposed to quit.

1007
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:51,361
Scott: Right.

1008
00:55:51,421 --> 00:56:08,960
Scott: It's like even if you've already lost, if the game is over, if you're not having a good time, if one of the other people sucks as a jerk, if people are playing slowly, if you have to go, you know, to somewhere legitimately, there's this sort of social obligation that like you feel like you can't leave.

1009
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,682
Scott: You have to stay.

1010
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,090
Scott: It's like, no, you absolutely can leave.

1011
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,160
Scott: Even if the other people are upset, you can leave.

1012
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:15,822
Scott: Right.

1013
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:16,866
Scott: You should leave.

1014
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,040
Scott: If you have any reason whatsoever to leave, leave.

1015
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:20,721
Rym: Yeah.

1016
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:30,180
Rym: Well, the way the way I actually look at that with games in particular, like a board game is there's like there's different like there's the mood where, say, five people are playing a game.

1017
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:34,009
Rym: One person is not having a great time, but they committed to playing.

1018
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:40,852
Rym: the game is a moderately different situation from something I see very commonly where nobody is having a good time.

1019
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:42,520
Rym: Literally no one in the game is having a good time.

1020
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,140
Scott: In either situation, either the one, you know, in the first situation, the one person should bail.

1021
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,060
Scott: In the second situation, everyone should collectively be like, yeah, you know, I don't want to play anymore.

1022
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,469
Scott: And everyone will say, yeah, you know what?

1023
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:53,797
Scott: We all don't want to play anymore.

1024
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:54,340
Scott: Just put it away.

1025
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,779
Scott: But the one I see the most common is... Bailing is the solution either way.

1026
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,255
Rym: The one I see the most in most common in board games is one person is having a good time.

1027
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,140
Rym: The rest of the table is not.

1028
00:57:05,641 --> 00:57:12,060
Rym: And usually the person who's having a good time, the bail wasn't during the game was actually too late to bail.

1029
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:19,780
Rym: The problem is actually that all the people in that game agreed to play the game in the first place, but didn't actually want to.

1030
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,720
Rym: They foresaw this situation, but they went along with it anyway, and then they reaped exactly what they sowed.

1031
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:33,700
Rym: Usually the person who's having a good time is the person who is aggressively trying to recruit people to play that game.

1032
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:37,369
Rym: Like, not the third South Park.

1033
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,156
Rym: Another relevant South Park episode.

1034
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:40,140
Rym: The zip lining.

1035
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:46,340
Rym: Where one person aggressively convinced other people to do the thing that sucked that no one liked.

1036
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:53,020
Rym: Be wary of anyone who is aggressively selling you on playing a board game with them at a convention.

1037
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,499
Rym: There is a reason why they are trying so hard.

1038
00:57:56,962 --> 00:58:01,660
Scott: I always find it interesting, there's so many overeager people who really want to do something.

1039
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,780
Scott: But those overeager people can't all find each other to form a group of overeager people.

1040
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:06,424
Rym: Oh, I've seen.

1041
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:06,666
Rym: I swear.

1042
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,320
Scott: That would be the perfect scenario for those people, but they somehow can't make it happen.

1043
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:16,780
Rym: So one thing that happens is sometimes those people overlap a little bit with that guy.

1044
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:23,640
Rym: And the only thing that that guy hates more than being excluded is being included by another that guy.

1045
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:33,820
Rym: But in terms of the games, not to get into that topic, I feel like usually what happens is those people are all really jazzed about different games.

1046
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,326
Scott: That can happen.

1047
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:46,136
Scott: So if your friends want to go walking up a mountain and every single friend is going up the mountain, and you don't like going up the mountain, you can just stay home like I did.

1048
00:58:46,237 --> 00:58:46,799
Scott: You don't have to go.

1049
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,008
Scott: No one's making you go.

1050
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,520
Scott: And look, those people are still my friend, I think.

1051
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:53,519
Rym: I guess when it comes down to it.

1052
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:54,931
Scott: They still see me.

1053
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:55,680
Scott: They still talk to me.

1054
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,151
Rym: In terms of practical advice, you have to think about whatever.

1055
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:02,140
Rym: there's a thing you could do, you need to actively think.

1056
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,930
Rym: Don't just go along or don't just passively think.

1057
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,620
Rym: Like, actively interrogate yourself.

1058
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,805
Rym: This is literal introspection.

1059
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:09,851
Rym: Do I want to do this?

1060
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:13,100
Rym: What do I expect this to be like?

1061
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:18,152
Rym: What is the likelihood that my expectations will match reality?

1062
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:20,860
Rym: And what are the expectations of the people around me?

1063
00:59:21,661 --> 00:59:24,900
Rym: Actually, seriously try to articulate the answers to those questions.

1064
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:30,500
Rym: Because I see so many times, and part of the reason why I bail so readily on things is in the past.

1065
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,984
Rym: There were many situations.

1066
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:35,980
Rym: There was a road trip that was the second worst road trip I've ever been on in my life.

1067
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,706
Rym: Huge disaster this whole trip.

1068
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,660
Rym: Not that the worst one was the one you and I went on together.

1069
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,020
Rym: With the ticket and the bad food and all that situation.

1070
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,340
Rym: But the second worst one, I foresaw that it was going to be a terrible road trip.

1071
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:55,440
Rym: I looked at this trip and I thought, wow, this is going to go wrong, this is going to go wrong, this is going to go wrong.

1072
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,120
Rym: There's no way this could be successful.

1073
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,920
Rym: But I decided against my own better nature to go along with it and be optimistic.

1074
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,440
Rym: Maybe it'll be better, maybe it'll be okay.

1075
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,330
Rym: And it was very much as the trip progressed, like by the second day, it was an open the envelope Lisa situation.

1076
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:21,170
Rym: As everything that I'd predicted had become true, the foretold had happened, the prophecy was fulfilled.

1077
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,530
Scott: So other things, right, is I want to, you know, a little more serious, right?

1078
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,680
Scott: Is you're talking about things like games and whatnot?

1079
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,590
Scott: is like you can bail, right?

1080
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:38,750
Scott: It is an option, at least, you know, at least if you're listening to this podcast, it's likely an option for you to bail on things that are like really serious.

1081
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:41,370
Scott: And you wouldn't normally think you could bail on.

1082
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:46,790
Scott: It's like your family has met for Thanksgiving every single year, your whole life, it's an automatic.

1083
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:47,788
Scott: You don't have to go to that.

1084
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:48,114
Scott: Yeah.

1085
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,689
Scott: No, there might be consequences.

1086
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:51,989
Rym: There might be fine.

1087
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,629
Scott: You might want to.

1088
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,122
Scott: Sure, there might be consequences for not going like.

1089
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:56,730
Scott: maybe someone's mad at you and your family.

1090
01:00:57,139 --> 01:00:57,350
Scott: Right.

1091
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:01,869
Scott: But if you don't have a good time doing it, you don't have to fucking go.

1092
01:01:02,432 --> 01:01:04,349
Scott: You could you you can do something else.

1093
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:06,129
Scott: You don't have to do that.

1094
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:06,820
Scott: Right.

1095
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:07,209
Scott: You need to.

1096
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:14,709
Scott: And I think you just even consider some people don't even consider that it's like that's an option, but it's always an option to not go.

1097
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:15,553
Scott: Right.

1098
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,610
Scott: You know, it's like school.

1099
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:20,009
Scott: You don't have to go to that.

1100
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:24,307
Scott: There is consequences, but you don't have to work.

1101
01:01:25,493 --> 01:01:26,238
Rym: I will say there are.

1102
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:27,750
Scott: you can just quit your job.

1103
01:01:27,993 --> 01:01:29,210
Scott: There are consequences.

1104
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:33,610
Scott: Some people are in a way better position and can do that more readily than other people.

1105
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:46,210
Scott: But if the shittier your job is, the lower paying and worse treated that you are at the job, you know, depending on where you live and your other situations in life, it might be easier.

1106
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,010
Scott: You know, don't quit if you need the money.

1107
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:48,253
Scott: Right.

1108
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:49,730
Scott: Don't quit before you find a new one.

1109
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,191
Scott: But you can.

1110
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:56,690
Scott: probably the worse the job is, it's might the easier it is to get over that bar and find something at least a little better.

1111
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:57,768
Scott: It might still be shitty.

1112
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:02,810
Scott: But, you know, so it's like you can quit.

1113
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,950
Scott: You know, don't just stay in your job because you got some routine or something.

1114
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:14,110
Rym: Well, part of what the part of the with in terms of real things is it comes down to to have you made affirmative commitments or not, because it's a very different situation.

1115
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:19,630
Rym: If Scott was like, hey, let's go, I don't know, something you'd want to do that I wouldn't give a shit about.

1116
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,390
Rym: Let's go to this net runner and Gundam making convention not to do panels.

1117
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:26,466
Rym: We're just going to show up.

1118
01:02:26,832 --> 01:02:27,810
Rym: We're going to do a meet and greet.

1119
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,350
Rym: And then we're just going to be at this con after that.

1120
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,849
Rym: Like, I'm not going to be super into that.

1121
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,790
Rym: But if we commit, like GeekNights is going to be at this con.

1122
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:37,530
Rym: I can't bail on that.

1123
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,289
Rym: Like I can bail on that.

1124
01:02:39,671 --> 01:02:40,753
Rym: But you generally should.

1125
01:02:40,793 --> 01:02:47,850
Rym: if you make a commitment, you should stick to that commitment or don't make the commitment in the first place or be honest about it.

1126
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,090
Rym: Like if Scott invited that con and I was like and maybe I don't bail yet.

1127
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,089
Rym: Maybe I don't say no.

1128
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:56,359
Rym: Maybe I say I'm not sure I need to decide.

1129
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,790
Rym: when do I need to make the decision by those.

1130
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:02,350
Rym: Those are the conversations to have.

1131
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,191
Rym: We have.

1132
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:09,808
Rym: I've gone to cons that I would have bailed on, but I'd signed a contract to go to that one car that we signed a contract to go to.

1133
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:10,710
Scott: that we could have.

1134
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:13,150
Rym: We could have bailed out if we'd known in advance.

1135
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:18,570
Scott: There are definitely things where you cross a line of no return.

1136
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:19,212
Scott: Right.

1137
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:23,130
Scott: And there is sometimes there's a return with it with a valid reason.

1138
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:25,770
Rym: Well, like, hey, I'm going to come to your wedding.

1139
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:27,310
Rym: Hey, I can't come to your wedding.

1140
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:29,670
Rym: I broke both my legs this morning.

1141
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:31,718
Scott: Right.

1142
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:32,389
Scott: That's a good one.

1143
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:36,770
Rym: Or I accidentally scheduled my own wedding that same day and didn't tell anyone.

1144
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:37,971
Scott: Right.

1145
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:41,490
Scott: Or it's like, hey, let's start a family and make babies together.

1146
01:03:41,691 --> 01:03:42,930
Scott: Actually, I'm going to just run away.

1147
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:45,670
Rym: It's like, you know, that's what I was going to bring up earlier.

1148
01:03:45,771 --> 01:03:48,350
Rym: If you can just bail on anything like that, just bail on, I don't know, kids.

1149
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,851
Scott: Right.

1150
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:55,030
Scott: It's like, you know, there are ways, you know, to go about, you know, you've crossed the line of no return.

1151
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:00,850
Scott: There are ways to, you know, divorce and do whatever, you know, in a way that is, you know, healthy.

1152
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:01,352
Scott: Right.

1153
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:05,370
Scott: And does not cause lots of damage and whatnot to other human beings.

1154
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:10,669
Rym: Well, like if we had to bail on a convention we'd committed to for a valid reason or even an invalid reason.

1155
01:04:11,772 --> 01:04:14,450
Scott: We promised you'd come to a convention, but a pandemic happened.

1156
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:14,773
Scott: Yep.

1157
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,210
Rym: Like, here's a formal email.

1158
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,229
Scott: A tornado hit my house.

1159
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,083
Rym: Like, here's here is why we're not coming.

1160
01:04:19,143 --> 01:04:19,970
Rym: Here's the situation.

1161
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,290
Rym: Let's discuss alternative.

1162
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:22,657
Rym: Like there's there's a whole.

1163
01:04:22,677 --> 01:04:25,350
Rym: or like another example, esports, like don't quit a game, right?

1164
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:30,950
Rym: If I just play Overwatch, I go to a random casual mode and then I just I'm bored and I just quit.

1165
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,530
Rym: Like, sure, that doesn't impact other people that much.

1166
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:35,380
Rym: And I didn't commit that much.

1167
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:37,010
Rym: I was playing in the random mode anyway.

1168
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:46,430
Rym: But if I affirmatively choose to join the competitive queue to play a competitive game, there is an implicit contract that I agree to finish the game I get put in.

1169
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:54,570
Rym: So it's a materially different situation to bail on that competitive game because I knew going in what I was committing to.

1170
01:04:57,532 --> 01:05:02,870
Rym: But I feel like generally people should bail more often than they do.

1171
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:13,690
Rym: I feel like a lot of people choose not to bail on things either out of misplaced senses of commitment or more often misplaced optimism about how that thing will go down.

1172
01:05:14,492 --> 01:05:18,746
Scott: Or misplaced or misinterpreted obligation or false obligation.

1173
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,679
Scott: For example, let's say you're at work, right?

1174
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,610
Scott: I'm not going to talk about quitting work anymore.

1175
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:27,830
Scott: Let's say you're at work and someone puts a meeting on your calendar.

1176
01:05:28,552 --> 01:05:29,579
Scott: You know, it's and it's a boss.

1177
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,130
Scott: A boss puts a meeting on your calendar.

1178
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:34,369
Scott: You can say, no, you don't you don't have to go.

1179
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,439
Scott: It's like too many meetings.

1180
01:05:36,479 --> 01:05:38,050
Scott: You know, you don't even need an excuse.

1181
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:40,404
Scott: You can just say like, no, I'm not going to that meeting.

1182
01:05:40,747 --> 01:05:41,129
Scott: I can't go.

1183
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:42,455
Scott: No one's going to make you.

1184
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:45,389
Scott: No one's probably not going to fire you right for something like that.

1185
01:05:45,751 --> 01:05:46,035
Scott: Right.

1186
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:47,127
Scott: It's like you don't got to go.

1187
01:05:48,151 --> 01:05:54,090
Scott: You know, someone says, hey, you know, you say you're working at the office and it comes around.

1188
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:59,030
Scott: It's like five o'clock and someone comes up and is like, hey, we got this thing we got to do.

1189
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,797
Scott: You can be like, you know, not to quit.

1190
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,529
Scott: You might get fired depending on how shitty your job is.

1191
01:06:04,051 --> 01:06:06,730
Scott: But, you know, if they say, hey, can you do this one more thing?

1192
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,621
Scott: You can be like, no, I'm good.

1193
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:09,346
Scott: It's five o'clock.

1194
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:09,990
Scott: I got to go home.

1195
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:10,633
Scott: I got to go.

1196
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:11,799
Scott: My kid's going to be home.

1197
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:13,870
Scott: I got to you know, I got stuff to do.

1198
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:14,775
Scott: I got to cook food.

1199
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:16,425
Scott: See, you know, you got to deal with that.

1200
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:17,190
Scott: That's not my problem.

1201
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:18,174
Rym: Yeah.

1202
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:21,870
Scott: But the optimism thing is pressured into doing something you don't got to do.

1203
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:27,269
Scott: Don't make it you know, don't make yourself feel like you must do something that you must not do.

1204
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:27,791
Scott: Yeah.

1205
01:06:27,872 --> 01:06:28,153
Scott: Right.

1206
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:32,370
Scott: Of course, you know, accurately evaluate the real consequences.

1207
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:33,151
Scott: Right.

1208
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:42,350
Scott: You know, some people, I think, imagine consequences that aren't real or imagine consequences to be worse than what they might really be.

1209
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,597
Scott: It's like, yeah, OK.

1210
01:06:43,658 --> 01:06:45,450
Scott: You know, at your job, there might be a shitty.

1211
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:53,370
Scott: There are definitely shitty jobs out there where someone will just fire you for just going home at the hour you're supposed to go home instead of doing the extra work.

1212
01:06:53,491 --> 01:06:53,732
Scott: Right.

1213
01:06:53,994 --> 01:06:56,350
Scott: But is that really what's going to happen?

1214
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:56,892
Scott: Right.

1215
01:06:57,233 --> 01:07:03,070
Scott: Is someone maybe going to come to you tomorrow and give you a stir in talking to like, hey, why didn't you do that thing?

1216
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,192
Scott: You're not a team player.

1217
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:04,413
Scott: Right.

1218
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:11,950
Scott: It's like, well, could you just, you know, quietly hear them say that and say sorry and you still have your job.

1219
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:15,382
Scott: So someone gives you a bad evaluation at work.

1220
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:16,084
Scott: That could happen.

1221
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:17,470
Scott: It's like, do you still have your job?

1222
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:18,513
Scott: Do you care?

1223
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:19,597
Scott: It's just a piece of paper.

1224
01:07:19,918 --> 01:07:20,058
Scott: Right.

1225
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,263
Scott: With a with a thing on it.

1226
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:21,564
Scott: Right.

1227
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,310
Scott: It's like, do you care about that?

1228
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:25,455
Scott: Maybe you do care about that.

1229
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:25,756
Scott: Right.

1230
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:26,318
Scott: But I don't.

1231
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,150
Scott: So it's like you had to consider what are the real consequences.

1232
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:32,114
Scott: Are you willing to suffer them?

1233
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:33,518
Scott: Are they really that bad?

1234
01:07:33,538 --> 01:07:34,079
Scott: Right.

1235
01:07:35,162 --> 01:07:38,170
Scott: Sometimes it's hard to realistically predict consequences.

1236
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,272
Scott: Yeah.

1237
01:07:39,613 --> 01:07:41,578
Scott: But, you know, maybe you can just ask.

1238
01:07:41,998 --> 01:07:42,219
Scott: Right.

1239
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:47,070
Scott: If someone says, hey, you want to do this, stay late and do this work and be like, well, what what if it doesn't get done?

1240
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:47,652
Scott: What will happen?

1241
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:51,281
Scott: Just ask, you know, honestly be like, hey, what what will happen if we just let that go till tomorrow?

1242
01:07:52,946 --> 01:07:54,410
Scott: Is that consequence really that bad?

1243
01:07:54,950 --> 01:08:00,002
Scott: You know, because if I stay and do it, here's what's going to happen to my life.

1244
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:00,564
Scott: Right.

1245
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:03,110
Rym: And it also gets complicated by what your goals are.

1246
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:08,350
Rym: So GeekNights, we bailed on a few shows recently just because we can finally see some of our friends together.

1247
01:08:08,511 --> 01:08:11,523
Rym: And like that's a that's a laser that I need to.

1248
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,070
Rym: it's been charging for over a year.

1249
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:17,450
Rym: Like that is a higher priority in my life than doing some individual GeekNights episode.

1250
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:28,069
Rym: But at the same time, when we started GeekNights, we agreed that we would try not to bail and do the Penny Arcade model of just crank the show out no matter what, even if it sucks.

1251
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,316
Rym: And that's how we'll force ourselves to get better.

1252
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:33,243
Scott: So we'd try to cross.

1253
01:08:33,304 --> 01:08:35,770
Scott: Let me cross the line of where it's not a problem anymore.

1254
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:39,790
Rym: But we do try not to bail on the show unless we have a good reason.

1255
01:08:40,231 --> 01:08:44,930
Rym: But if we have a good reason, like Scott and I will discuss, like, hey, should we bail on the show?

1256
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,700
Rym: And we we like we try to make that decision immediately.

1257
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:51,970
Rym: Like if we're going to bail on a show, we make the decision as early as possible.

1258
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:53,356
Rym: That's we're not going to show that day.

1259
01:08:53,577 --> 01:08:54,542
Rym: We don't even worry about it.

1260
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:55,426
Rym: We walk away.

1261
01:08:55,488 --> 01:08:55,870
Rym: We're fine.

1262
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,290
Scott: But there's no consequences for not doing a GeekNights episode.

1263
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:06,010
Rym: But putting that pressure on ourselves to not bail early on was a very powerful tool to make us get good in a hurry.

1264
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:07,675
Rym: And there are pros and cons to that.

1265
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:12,988
Rym: But the fact that we chose it and we could have bailed, we chose not to.

1266
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,774
Scott: You could just bail on the whole show.

1267
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:16,483
Scott: We could just never do any Internet stuff again.

1268
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:18,250
Scott: We could just be like, bye, delete all social media.

1269
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:19,233
Scott: We could do it right now.

1270
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:20,537
Scott: Delete website.

1271
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:22,687
Scott: I could just turn everything off in like two seconds.

1272
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:23,550
Scott: It would be really quick.

1273
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:26,175
Rym: But no, instead, we're weird nerds.

1274
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:33,069
Rym: And so unlike every other website, even if you link to GeekNights in like 2006, those links probably still work.

1275
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:34,941
Scott: They will definitely work.

1276
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,009
Scott: I guarantee it.

1277
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,737
Rym: And I think we've gone on.

1278
01:09:38,858 --> 01:09:42,270
Rym: For a show talking about bailing, we've gone on longer than a normal episode of GeekNights.

1279
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,689
Rym: So I think this is a good point to wrap up.

1280
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,750
Scott: We haven't done a show in a while, so we made up for the previous two or three shows we didn't do.

1281
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,738
Rym: And we'll be on a semi-regular schedule as time goes on.

1282
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,330
Rym: But for now, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1283
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:59,450
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1284
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:04,870
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1285
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,817
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1286
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:12,550
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1287
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,066
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1288
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,400
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1289
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:23,490
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1290
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:49,010
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNicholallen, Joyce Link, E.G, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, JustLikeADudeGuy, KshayaYa85, Programmed, Throwed, Openspeed, UndertakeLaw, Adoption Pierce, Absorb, Rebecca Dunn, Revue, Madbull34, Howards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, Taylor Braun, You Old, The Key To My Heart, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1291
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:54,410
Rym: Yeah, we bailed on the show on Tuesday, so I figured we'd do a show on bailin', but you won't see us bailin' that much.

1292
01:10:54,570 --> 01:11:04,550
Rym: And you're gonna see a lot of GeekNights streams, you're gonna see a pretty relatively faster turnaround time on Roomly Reviews and the whole Disney show.

1293
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:07,530
Rym: You're gonna see a few of those that we're gonna queue up in the immediate future.

1294
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:10,205
Rym: But for now, I leave you with...

1295
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,949
Scott: I'm gonna eat chips for lunch.

1296
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,266
Rym: Spicy chips.

1297
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:23,627
Scott: Spicy chips.

1298
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,159
Scott: Mmm, spicy chips.

1299
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,839
Rym: Ooh, they make me gassy.

1300
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,177
Rym: But I love spicy chips.

1301
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,720
Rym: Are you eating chips for lunch again?

1302
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,123
Scott: No.
