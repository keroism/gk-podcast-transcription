1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,617
Rym: Hey, it's Monday October 18th.

2
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,420
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,830
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight because it's been at least a year.

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,950
Rym: It's a tech news roundup.

5
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,864
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:33,679
Rym: So as you all know I went about a hundred and sixty eight hundred and seventy hours without caffeine last week My epic anti caffeine odyssey,

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,508
Scott: so I guess you drink caffeine today of

8
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:48,590
Rym: course But my plan was to reduce my dependence and get out of the physical addiction stage and then Experience something I haven't experienced in many years what a caffeine rush feels like when you haven't become completely a hundred percent tolerant to it.

9
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:52,878
Rym: so Observations because a lot of people were really interested in this.

10
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:03,750
Rym: the withdrawal symptoms are real and they occur like clockwork 48 hours after your last coffee splitting headache and then for like the next few days aches and all your joints mm-hmm.

11
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,401
Rym: And then you'll feel completely normal.

12
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:14,190
Rym: I don't feel different though I expected that maybe caffeine was doing something to me that maybe I would feel like more awake or different in my life.

13
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:15,169
Scott: Just can't tell.

14
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:18,609
Rym: Maybe I mean it might be a Jekyll and Hyde syndrome.

15
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:22,405
Rym: But the one thing I can say is I don't feel different.

16
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,310
Rym: I feel normal.

17
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:28,589
Rym: I feel the way that I felt when I had caffeine in my system when I was addicted mm-hmm.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,770
Rym: But when I consumed caffeine over lunch today after having gone a complete week without any it was a fucking rush.

19
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:36,757
Rym: It was awesome.

20
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,450
Rym: It was really awesome.

21
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:41,190
Rym: So now I did a bunch of research.

22
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:59,069
Rym: I feel like if I have no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine Per two days I can maintain at most a low level tolerance yet at the same time not achieve total tolerance and enjoy all the benefits of caffeine without all the Pain in the ass of having to constantly take caffeine just to stay awake.

23
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,674
Scott: Yeah Let's see.

24
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:09,949
Scott: so today right I went to work Yeah, and then I realized since I'd worked from home on Friday my work computer was home.

25
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:13,361
Scott: So I got to work and there was no computer.

26
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,630
Rym: so I daddy to work computers.

27
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,316
Scott: So I went.

28
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,286
Scott: I went all the way home.

29
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:17,366
Scott: now

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,459
Rym: I got a work laptop that I leave at home

31
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,495
Scott: when all I went all the way home and then all the way back Again

32
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:30,314
Rym: see if you had dynamic DNS setup And you left the laptop on you could have remote desktop into it from work And then worked

33
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,639
Scott: from what computer at work.

34
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,064
Rym: You don't have any computer at work.

35
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:33,766
Rym: Just the laptop.

36
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:34,208
Scott: That's it.

37
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,590
Rym: Oh Wow actually at work.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:44,430
Rym: I got this huge like quad-core Ubuntu development box And then I got my normal like quad-core Windows PC, and then I got my work laptop.

39
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:48,423
Scott: Yeah, just have it the one computer the stupid Mac which I have.

40
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,390
Rym: I also actually have a terminal server.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,219
Rym: So if all those computers die I can are.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,159
Rym: I can remote desktop into a terminal server that has all the stuff I need on it.

43
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:01,576
Scott: Also Over the weekend.

44
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:03,869
Scott: I actually tried to make donuts for reals that you did.

45
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,261
Rym: I I would have come to your donut thing, but I had other plans.

46
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:09,047
Scott: that the it's alright.

47
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,219
Scott: because the donuts You know I don't they were not that it was weird.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,901
Scott: They were not.

49
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,270
Rym: that magnificent should have used more trans fat.

50
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,670
Scott: Yeah, I know, but I learned a lot about donutting and I'm sure my it will improve greatly.

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,087
Scott: But the thing was is when I went back home to get that computer that I left there I grabbed one of the donuts that I put in a ziploc bag.

52
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,550
Rym: was it good?

53
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:38,430
Scott: It was much better actually better than it was when it was fresh out of the oil Which is the opposite of what I was going for because the place in Seattle fresh out of the oil They're like oh, you're gonna die you're gonna wait in line and fork over your whole wallet.

54
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:42,350
Rym: I waited in line for 40 minutes to get those donuts again on Sunday.

55
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:45,807
Scott: But if you but if you get them after they've been sitting there a while.

56
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:46,350
Scott: They're no good.

57
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:58,310
Scott: You know I ended up making the opposite like when I ate the donut that was like You know like sat in the plastic bag overnight And it was much superior to the donut that I you know when it was fresh the day before.

58
00:03:58,611 --> 00:03:59,976
Rym: Huh, maybe the oil congealed.

59
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,381
Rym: well what it was is hot.

60
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:12,721
Scott: the edges of the donut the crust part You know the surface was still slightly burninated because of you know factors like using butter inside the donut Which I shouldn't have done and inconsistent oil temperature.

61
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,690
Rym: We definitely have a pro butter bias.

62
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:18,769
Rym: Yeah, sometimes butter is not the answer, but I always feel like I can make like the answer.

63
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,141
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm gonna do is well cuz why I like butter?

64
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,648
Scott: because doesn't have trans fat right.

65
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,634
Rym: well remember we can't.

66
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:27,153
Rym: you can't use if you want to do the Project DT.

67
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:30,504
Rym: Yeah, don't actually DT works for that.

68
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:34,830
Scott: You can't use the trans fats And I gotta figure out what's going on with that.

69
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,602
Scott: But anyway if I I'm gonna try to use peanut oils right.

70
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:48,639
Scott: if I use peanut oil for the frying I can Filter it and reuse it over and over again because I had to use a whole tub of Crisco to fry this Donuts and it still wasn't enough.

71
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,469
Rym: I would add to bite you fried them in Crisco straight up.

72
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,578
Scott: Yeah, whoa that's what you're supposed to do.

73
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:54,221
Rym: when I was a kid.

74
00:04:54,261 --> 00:05:00,422
Scott: We always used like safflower oil Supposedly supposed to use safflower oil for stir-frying, but not for deep frying.

75
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,646
Scott: Oh, that's what they.

76
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:02,529
Scott: that's what people say.

77
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,279
Rym: yeah You know I've read the same forum thread.

78
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,090
Scott: no, but I'll sir on the Internet.

79
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:07,510
Scott: I didn't read it in the forum.

80
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:12,384
Scott: but I'm gonna get peanut oil and I'm gonna use the peanut oil can reuse cuz I mean that's how.

81
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,928
Scott: but Crisco was six bucks and I would have needed actually two of them to make it deep enough.

82
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:21,590
Scott: and Reusing Crisco is not great because you want to let it cool before you rebottle it or whatever.

83
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:25,130
Scott: But if you let Crisco cool it turns into white goop, and you have to scrape.

84
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,962
Scott: It's no good, but the peanut oil will stay liquid right.

85
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,790
Scott: so I get the peanut oil.

86
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:40,270
Scott: I'll fry the donuts in peanut oil, but I'll use Crisco in the donuts themselves Such that they'll be full of trans fat and therefore delicious they will not.

87
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,767
Scott: You know well it is zero trans fat per serving in the Crisco way.

88
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,310
Rym: Yeah See I'm dubious of that.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,043
Rym: I mean if the ingredients say zero trans fat for this tiny serving and they also say Constituted almost entirely of partially hydrogenated oils.

90
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:06,907
Scott: Yeah There's no trans fat in there at all is there, but anyway the you know I'll put that in the donut itself because it's actually a relatively small portion of the of the whole right.

91
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:13,849
Scott: I mean this recipe that I used had like three and a half cups of flour and all this other stuff and like half a stick of butter.

92
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,410
Scott: wait I got an idea, so it's not a lot of Crisco that goes into the actual dough.

93
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,356
Rym: I got a really good idea because we you know we didn't go apple picking last weekend and this coming weekend is the last Goddamn weekend.

94
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,410
Rym: you can go apple picking and have it be even worth going.

95
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,817
Rym: Mm-hmm if we go apple picking They'll be cider donuts.

96
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:30,882
Scott: you want to ask them what there is.

97
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:34,599
Rym: you should just be friendly and be like hey What's the recipe for these cider donuts?

98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,470
Rym: and watch them and like see how they're making them?

99
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,675
Scott: They just you know what they're gonna have.

100
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:41,110
Scott: they're gonna have a machine and they're gonna have a bag full of powder.

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,046
Scott: They're gonna add water to it And they're gonna dump it in the top of the machine and then out come the side and just be seriously.

102
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,050
Rym: just ask him like alright Where'd you get that white powder?

103
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,502
Rym: They buy it from a food distribute and find out who that food distributor is.

104
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:57,440
Scott: and I mean if you get it from any food Distributor yeah, it's just donut mix.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,729
Rym: so why not use the stuff that tastes the best?

106
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,320
Scott: Cuz that stuff isn't necessarily the best.

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,621
Scott: I got it.

108
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,584
Scott: I want to make it special.

109
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,388
Scott: right you got to go.

110
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:08,122
Rym: project Cup noodle on this like you look at Chipotle.

111
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,710
Scott: right Chipotle doesn't just order.

112
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:16,170
Scott: You know that meat from you know I mean they do order it But it's like they prepare it and it's so they got a recipe that they prepare at the Chipotle.

113
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:16,816
Scott: That's like.

114
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:18,490
Scott: that's what sets them apart Scott.

115
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,333
Rym: It's like the cup noodle.

116
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,948
Rym: when they found the the ultra fancy particular one shrimp that stayed pink.

117
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,517
Scott: exactly That's what I got to do.

118
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,027
Scott: I got to do project X donut.

119
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,691
Rym: You know I can't just be but I think the way to go about this would be to first go around and sample everyone else's Cider.

120
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,082
Scott: I've already done that in my whole life.

121
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:33,686
Scott: I have 28 years.

122
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,896
Rym: Oh, yeah, and you know what my experience has been.

123
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,944
Rym: all cider donuts are fucking awesome.

124
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:38,666
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

125
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:39,650
Scott: That's why I'm trying to make.

126
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:46,769
Scott: I'm also gonna experiment with glaze because you can't be a donut king if you don't know about glaze.

127
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,504
Rym: But you know you know why is glaze cider donut?

128
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,067
Rym: fuck that.

129
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:50,670
Rym: what do you mean?

130
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,095
Scott: You make like a cider glaze.

131
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:55,508
Rym: no no if you're gonna make a glaze donut like that the key is maple.

132
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:56,793
Rym: maple glaze Maple glaze.

133
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:57,215
Scott: very good.

134
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,039
Rym: That's the way to go.

135
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,130
Scott: I think is that so I got experiment with glazes.

136
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,656
Scott: I got to know all about glaze.

137
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,865
Scott: I gotta be and I'm gonna glaze all kinds of shit.

138
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,130
Scott: glaze pretzels.

139
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,847
Rym: Glaze fruit glaze pretzel does not sound so good.

140
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,279
Scott: Oh come on Do you get like a you know a chocolate-covered pretzel?

141
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,388
Scott: now just imagine glaze strawberry glaze pretzel.

142
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,997
Scott: Yeah, it would be like.

143
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,530
Scott: it would be like fucking Pocky with Saul's.

144
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,519
Rym: So it sounds like double Pocky with.

145
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,505
Rym: sounds like project DT is the backup plan of project st And project continue to work at a job.

146
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,109
Rym: both fail.

147
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,390
Scott: I think they're all project fail.

148
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:39,826
Scott: But you know the thing is if there's anything that I've learned over the past many years It's that the things that are awesome are not the things that you try to do the accidents right.

149
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,169
Scott: Twitter was an accident.

150
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,020
Scott: Almost everything was an accident and not intentional.

151
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,065
Rym: so how come with GeekNights?

152
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:49,706
Rym: we never made anything To accomplish something that itself was useful independently.

153
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,196
Scott: I made a Podcasting website.

154
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,770
Rym: yeah, if only podcasting mattered.

155
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:03,269
Scott: I think our problem is that we use money a lot of times instead of making something right like if we would have made a Mixer that was like the ultimate podcasting mixer instead of buying one.

156
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:13,779
Rym: Then we would have like a product that we could sell except There's a million podcasting mixers that are way cheap made with Chinese parts, and I couldn't do better than that on my own No But I mean just in terms of the feature set.

157
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:19,830
Scott: right because we would design one that have like more inputs And a USB and you know all these things that no one is gonna make.

158
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,253
Rym: Here's the problem.

159
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:29,889
Rym: when I was doing all my research because you know we're the problem really is that we do our own research And my research showed that oh all that exists, and it's actually really cheap

160
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:30,873
Scott: Mm-hmm,

161
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:31,857
Rym: so I just bought it,

162
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:37,150
Scott: but I mean there's always something that I'm like oh They should do this like that doesn't exist there's no market for it.

163
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,162
Scott: It's like the in-between product you know.

164
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:42,718
Rym: yeah except the problem There is a lot of times there really isn't a market for.

165
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:43,742
Rym: I mean look at podcasting.

166
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,050
Rym: podcasting is basically dead.

167
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:59,614
Rym: Like it is such a niche that most podcasts that are popular are professional or semi-professional like us anyway And the other half it's just Skype and like that Logitech stick microphone Actually nowadays.

168
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:02,565
Rym: I think a lot of people use like Xbox style headset, whatever.

169
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,870
Scott: you know they're using something.

170
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,186
Rym: Oh, so get this total randomness.

171
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,502
Rym: Emily And I went to a jazz club last night that also had awesome barbecue.

172
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,128
Rym: you know that blue smoke barbecue place?

173
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,536
Rym: no Well, it's in.

174
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:13,482
Rym: it's like 28th Street.

175
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:16,577
Rym: They have awesome barbecue Underneath in the basement.

176
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,529
Rym: It's the same restaurant, but it's a jazz club.

177
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,486
Rym: So you get the full meal, and you just eat it while they play jazz mm-hmm.

178
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:23,209
Rym: It was okay.

179
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:30,808
Rym: It was kind of avant-garde you know guy in a saxophone going For like 20 minutes all righty.

180
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:38,118
Rym: But that aside on the way home right biggest fan of that as always the are came Much sooner than the end of the queue.

181
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,130
Rym: so we took the our home and in Queens Plaza station.

182
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:47,630
Rym: There was you know those white like four foot by three foot like metal doors that are always locked.

183
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,109
Rym: They're just all over the place in the subway.

184
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,402
Rym: No, they're like steel plates that like their doors, and they aren't.

185
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:53,924
Rym: they lock.

186
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,249
Rym: one of them was just open.

187
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:56,878
Rym: There's no one around.

188
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,629
Rym: so I crawled in there to take a look.

189
00:10:59,091 --> 00:10:59,793
Rym: And there's there.

190
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:05,010
Rym: basically it was in the wall and the wall is all tiled and there's like ads and posters like a subway wall.

191
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:09,760
Rym: right Inside of this plate Was a crawlspace.

192
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,254
Rym: it was about two and a half feet wide And it was just.

193
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,708
Rym: it was tall enough to walk in like a hallway any rats get you?

194
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:15,009
Rym: nah.

195
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,066
Rym: And it was cleaned and it followed the entire length of the hallway.

196
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:25,689
Rym: You know what it was Another wall with old ass ads still in frames right behind it.

197
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:32,310
Rym: Uh-huh like they built another wall two feet in front of the original wall and left all the ads and everything in there.

198
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,350
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I I can't figure out what the fuck the reason is for that.

199
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,010
Rym: But I gotta go back sometime at night.

200
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,390
Rym: There was a guard kind of hanging out, and I saw that I was poking at it.

201
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,610
Rym: So we left before he bothered us.

202
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,082
Rym: I gotta go back when no one's looking and go in there and see what's up.

203
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,670
Rym: Yeah, maybe take some videos.

204
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,760
Scott: It's probably just you know the structure of it.

205
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,930
Scott: It's like that's how they do you know yeah?

206
00:11:51,010 --> 00:12:00,149
Rym: But they built a wall and the thing is it wasn't like that subway station is even that old and the wall in there was Relatively clean and new and there was just an even newer wall in front of it.

207
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:02,270
Scott: How old were the ads in back there?

208
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,876
Rym: I gotta go back and look.

209
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:08,556
Rym: they mean they look kind of faded at least a year or two Okay, but it was no.

210
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,061
Rym: It's not like 1940s.

211
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,586
Rym: Burma shave something crazy.

212
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,949
Scott: I was like yeah I was like is it Burma shave?

213
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,671
Scott: It's like what the hell's back there.

214
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,253
Rym: No casks of a Monti auto or anything.

215
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:20,053
Scott: Oh shit.

216
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:29,220
Rym: Oh well so things of the day.

217
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:30,705
Rym: This one's real simple.

218
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:31,749
Rym: It's a girl with a ball.

219
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:32,913
Rym: That's all all right.

220
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,438
Rym: It's pretty awesome actually.

221
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,770
Scott: yeah I think it's the best one ball juggling ever seen.

222
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,255
Rym: I'd say so I want to see.

223
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,720
Rym: look Burj try to do something like that.

224
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:41,986
Scott: I don't think he can.

225
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,253
Rym: no probably not.

226
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,118
Scott: and now he's gonna cuz.

227
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:47,944
Scott: I challenge Whatever.

228
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:51,059
Rym: now he'll call a shit talk debt until we do some of the things we've talked about.

229
00:12:52,321 --> 00:13:02,055
Scott: Anyway, there's a if you remember in the olden days of the old Prodigy the oldest prodigy for like IBM ps1 DOS prodigy.

230
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:03,620
Rym: I had that at school.

231
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,232
Rym: I never had that at home right?

232
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,180
Scott: I had friends who had it.

233
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:15,773
Scott: They had IBM ps1 and they had because their dad worked at IBM still works at IBM and they had Prodigy on this IBM ps1 and is the oldest prodigy.

234
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:19,585
Scott: and there was a game you could play on it called madman Fuck mad maze.

235
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,533
Rym: that game sucked, but I loved it.

236
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:22,557
Scott: Yeah, no right.

237
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:25,900
Scott: There's the only game There was some other fun stuff to do was never winter nights.

238
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,817
Scott: You had to pay for that, but mad maze is the best game on there.

239
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:33,280
Rym: pretty much I remember I would play mad maze, but and it was fine.

240
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:38,524
Rym: But I never beat it because I had a 2400 baud modem 2400 baud.

241
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,714
Rym: it would always time out before it finished saving my game.

242
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,500
Rym: So I always had to start from the beginning.

243
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:47,154
Rym: That's when I gave up and started playing magic in the chat rooms instead.

244
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:47,736
Scott: Yeah.

245
00:13:48,198 --> 00:14:01,023
Scott: So anyway There's apparently this website at pages dot prodigy dot net something something where you can play mad maze 2 in your browser But you need to do some fiddling with your browser because it was designed This is made in 2001.

246
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,694
Scott: So it's made to work with like ie5 plus some.

247
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:10,499
Scott: you might have to break out a virtual machine with Some old-ass windows 95 or something, you know to make this thing go.

248
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,770
Scott: But if you do that, you'll be all.

249
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,750
Scott: maybe Windows 98 would actually probably best But if you do that, you'll probably all set.

250
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:24,339
Scott: I might actually work in ie6 I don't know, but it's not gonna work in your real modern browser unless you do some crazy hackage.

251
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,715
Scott: But otherwise, it's actually you can play mad maze - it's there.

252
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,000
Scott: It does work.

253
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:32,456
Scott: Damn, yeah, how about that?

254
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:32,940
Rym: All right.

255
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:39,440
Rym: So very briefly in the meta moment up next in the GeekNights lineup is magfest in January.

256
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,107
Rym: We're doing one panel by our panel.

257
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:42,909
Rym: losing should be fun.

258
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:50,222
Rym: We're also now part of something called the mag nine mag nine Alright, and basically I do any other panels But one.

259
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:54,560
Rym: we're doing one panel and then we're going to split up and sit on some of all these other panel.

260
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:07,579
Rym: They've got a whole bunch of pretty high-powered Awesome people in the gaming industry and they're gonna split us all up and sit on panels and talk about stuff I don't know how much I like, you know, the many people I like our panel doing.

261
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,588
Rym: well We don't do panels.

262
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,819
Rym: you realize what we do is lectures.

263
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:10,700
Scott: I know that's right.

264
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,673
Rym: So I want to do are actually panels which I like being on.

265
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,687
Rym: because think of this if you've got a panel That's actually smart people.

266
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,979
Scott: Well, I hope that it's not nine people on the panel.

267
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,186
Rym: It's gonna be four.

268
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:29,467
Rym: five absolute max is five mostly four Uh-huh, and they're gonna split it all up and like someone will be on like this one in this one depending on what they're interested In what they have stuff to say about that.

269
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,640
Rym: That's what that thread that email thread your cc'd on is all about.

270
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,536
Scott: But yeah, I know why we only do one panel.

271
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,199
Scott: I'll do more panels.

272
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,315
Rym: That's all they want is to do is one panel which has to do one more.

273
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,280
Scott: and why are we doing that one?

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,271
Scott: We should do Game mechanics to make it was done instead.

275
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:44,659
Rym: now losing should be fun.

276
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,115
Rym: At least none of the people there have probably seen it and it's a good penalty.

277
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,092
Rym: was that originally I also really wanted to do?

278
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,420
Rym: I don't know the Miku panel.

279
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,403
Rym: I want to do everything.

280
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:54,929
Scott: so yeah, why did they?

281
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,060
Rym: uh, anyway, it was that or beyond Candyland where the two they really wanted.

282
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:01,489
Scott: Yeah, uh Beyond Canada would have been real good.

283
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:02,032
Scott: We should done that.

284
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,080
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll do it.

285
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:03,869
Rym: You know what we could do.

286
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,673
Rym: if people are interested We can just go find a spot and just do it like out in the hall.

287
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:08,758
Rym: So we need a projector.

288
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:09,120
Scott: It's weird.

289
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,287
Scott: Then I'll buy a projector.

290
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,555
Rym: No, it's a little handheld one.

291
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,038
Scott: That's all you.

292
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,166
Rym: Also, we've got axes coming up.

293
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:20,260
Scott: axes in March get a hotel now or get a hotel yesterday.

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,590
Rym: We've got anime Boston in April.

295
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:23,052
Rym: it's coming.

296
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:23,555
Rym: we'll be there.

297
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:24,660
Scott: it's a while for now.

298
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,967
Scott: I think anime Boston panel reg went up.

299
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,913
Scott: You can apply to get it beyond a panel.

300
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:29,315
Scott: Yes.

301
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:30,519
Scott: That's all you.

302
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:38,393
Scott: And if so, anyone knows book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks is about zombies.

303
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:39,699
Rym: I'm so not looking forward to that.

304
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,459
Rym: Okay, but also for anyone who's interested PAX East panel submissions are not yet up.

305
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:47,151
Scott: Hotels are though.

306
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:47,899
Scott: get a hotel room.

307
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,406
Scott: Otherwise, you're gonna be fun.

308
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,219
Rym: from what I can read all the really close hotels are already sold out.

309
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:59,300
Scott: It's like that's what you get for not reaching immediately and I'm gonna tell immediately the hotel that we reg for sold out that day.

310
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,740
Scott: Yeah, why don't Pete like people just don't get it.

311
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Scott: It's like listen if you want to go if you have any interesting going whatsoever.

312
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,599
Scott: No, no, you can cancel these things like a couple days beforehand.

313
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,122
Rym: it's no.

314
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:16,819
Rym: it's because of the cultures are different in packs because of the fact that you can just cancel and Because the fact that you can resell the badges.

315
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,306
Rym: People are the weird.

316
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,329
Rym: They're not as rushed.

317
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,273
Rym: They don't sell out as quick.

318
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:21,599
Rym: Look at Otakon hotels.

319
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,632
Rym: Those fuckers sell out almost immediately.

320
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:24,980
Scott: You just got to go immediately.

321
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,280
Rym: Look at the artists alley it like Otakon it sells out like in second.

322
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,260
Scott: Listen people don't hesitate on this shit.

323
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,380
Scott: If you want to go to San Diego Comic Con, you got to buy your badges for the next one at the current one.

324
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,305
Scott: That's how it works.

325
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,320
Scott: You got to get your hotel room for the next one at the current one.

326
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,020
Scott: All right, and if you can't plan that far ahead in advance then just don't even be disappointed.

327
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,727
Scott: Just just be like, alright, I'm never going.

328
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,980
Scott: just pretend you're never going and just don't even think about it.

329
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,087
Scott: No, I'm disappointed if you can't commit.

330
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:54,680
Rym: I have much more important advice delay delay delay.

331
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:58,005
Rym: Order your badges like the last minute like when they say they're gonna sell out.

332
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:03,075
Rym: wait until the last second get some cheapo hotel like a mile from the con because that Just makes it so much easier for me.

333
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:12,788
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna have a real terrible experience traveling back and forth to the con from faraway hotels and all that You know, don't be doing that.

334
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:20,140
Rym: The thing is at least with tax I mean with an anime con like Otakon or anime Boston even it's not like you can resell your badge easily.

335
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,594
Rym: so a lot of people probably delay the pre-registration because they don't know if they're gonna go.

336
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:34,217
Rym: and a lot of hotels at anime con specifically anime cons require large deposits and Such or even will require non-refundable deposits and a couple of conventions.

337
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:41,500
Rym: I've seen Are so prone to canceling rooms at the last second, man, and it's actually becoming a big problem.

338
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:44,520
Rym: But with packs you can totally just resell your badge.

339
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,600
Rym: So if you even consider for a second, you might go to pack.

340
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:52,540
Rym: There is no reason not to buy a badge because they will be trivial to sell that badge and you're already too slow.

341
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,626
Scott: You should have gotten it a few days ago.

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,220
Rym: Anyway, in fact, if you're a jerk you could scalp it and make some money.

343
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:56,783
Rym: Let's go.

344
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,466
Scott: Let's continue.

345
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,033
Scott: So tech news roundup.

346
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,480
Rym: tech news roundup.

347
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,166
Scott: So actually a lot of the new.

348
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:05,923
Scott: we haven't done this in a while and actually been light on tech news even light on Monday Shows.

349
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,160
Scott: if it was Monday show ideas, let us know.

350
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,048
Rym: So all you new listeners good Monday show ideas.

351
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:15,300
Rym: tech news roundup is code for Rym and Scott didn't have shit to talk about.

352
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,343
Scott: That's right.

353
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:21,076
Scott: But there is at least one source of a ton of tech news slash dot.

354
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,700
Scott: Well, no, I'm not talking about.

355
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,946
Scott: I'm talking about a thing right?

356
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:30,140
Scott: So Oracle they have done many things lately which have resulted in numerous news is in sequence.

357
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,806
Scott: So this is pretty much three, right?

358
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,873
Rym: That was perhaps as vague as you could possibly be.

359
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:35,318
Scott: Okay, so the first thing right?

360
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,088
Scott: Well, I mean, let me go through the whole story right.

361
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,111
Scott: so my.

362
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,619
Rym: so there's a man named Larry Ellison, that's too far in.

363
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,886
Rym: So slash just as an aside.

364
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:56,557
Rym: slash dot pointed out because I don't like Larry Ellison and I really don't like Oracle and slash someone anonymous on slash dot I'm stealing their joke pointed out that Oracle actually stands for one rich asshole called Larry Ellison.

365
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,540
Rym: Yeah, anyway continue.

366
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:09,530
Scott: So anyway, there's Sun Microsystems, right and recently Sun Microsystems bought MySQL and that put Java and MySQL And open star office all together under the same roof.

367
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,156
Rym: three very important open source II things that suddenly are Under the nominal control also also virtual box.

368
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:22,020
Rym: Ah shit Yeah, it's then but it was remember Oracle is a company that has a history of being dicks.

369
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,007
Scott: They're pretty much is the worst right?

370
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,171
Scott: I mean you think Microsoft is bad.

371
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,074
Scott: now Oracle's the worst.

372
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,419
Rym: Microsoft fights against Oracle.

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,680
Rym: It's kind of like watching two evil giants fighting and you don't really want either one of them to win.

374
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:36,876
Scott: But you don't want I mean apples bad - it's like the three evil Google's standing up for us.

375
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,345
Scott: Yeah, barely So you've got.

376
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,537
Scott: Oracle comes in and buys sons now.

377
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:43,725
Scott: It's like oh shit What's gonna happen?

378
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,358
Scott: all this good stuff that Sun was up to?

379
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:50,647
Rym: well I recall when all these newses were announced way back, you know That Oracle basically started owning all this stuff.

380
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:56,892
Rym: a lot the the posts on things like slashed out and digger about 50/50 half the nerds Saying this is the end.

381
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:57,860
Rym: We got to watch out.

382
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,723
Rym: They're gonna do evil stuff.

383
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,012
Rym: the other half people saying they haven't done anything.

384
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:01,414
Rym: evil.

385
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,060
Rym: Java is always gonna be Java.

386
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,309
Rym: they're not gonna like close my SQL.

387
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:15,949
Scott: and well, the first thing they did right is Apparently there was some sort of drama discussion among like the open office Leading people or so.

388
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,234
Scott: I don't even know what the hell they are.

389
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,760
Rym: But wasn't it the guiding board?

390
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,240
Scott: I guess something like that and basically Oracle asked a bunch of the people on the board to leave for conflict of interest reasons.

391
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,517
Scott: Whatever it's like what?

392
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,140
Scott: Something weird is going on there, right?

393
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,250
Scott: I don't know what's up with that and it's like do they want to like Take open office and close it up or do something evil with it.

394
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,590
Scott: I don't know but it's not looking too good, but Luckily, it looks like.

395
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,295
Scott: do you remember when?

396
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:51,362
Scott: X3 86 changed their license and was all evil and weird and then there was X or and then they just came out with X Or gonna.

397
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:52,970
Scott: no one uses x86 anymore.

398
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,518
Scott: I don't know if anyone's working on x86.

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,940
Rym: It doesn't look like the same things happening here with LibreOffice.

400
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:06,848
Scott: yeah, basically all these things that Oracle is fucking up with their evilness are just getting forked and They're gonna be like X org, right?

401
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,460
Scott: So instead of open office, you're gonna use LibreOffice.

402
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,834
Scott: No one's gonna think about open office anymore in a few years.

403
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:12,719
Rym: So what about my SQL?

404
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,260
Scott: Well, there hasn't been any news about that later now, but there has been news about open Solaris Which also they pretty much just canceled it.

405
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:27,150
Scott: It's like oh, yeah, we're Yeah, we're gonna just get rid of open Solaris, you know, it's done.

406
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,860
Scott: We're gonna we're gonna go just stick with the commercial Solaris.

407
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,358
Scott: it's like well great guys, thanks a lot for that.

408
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:36,702
Scott: and the other thing is Java.

409
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,086
Scott: there's some weirdness with Java.

410
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,536
Rym: Well, it's particularly Java mobile because there's basically all.

411
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,844
Scott: no, it's actually no listen It's all Java's right?

412
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,855
Rym: So I only know about the mobile thing with the the job.

413
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:48,060
Scott: It's all related.

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:57,981
Scott: So basically the thing is is they decided with IBM, right that they're going to concentrate on all the Java standard edition Development.

415
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,409
Scott: concentration will be on the open JDK.

416
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,633
Scott: That's what they're gonna concentrate on.

417
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,579
Scott: and IBM was like, okay, let's do that, right?

418
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,485
Rym: Wait now open JDK.

419
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:06,188
Rym: That sounds great.

420
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:06,730
Rym: It's open.

421
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:07,292
Scott: It is.

422
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,075
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:08,718
Scott: Okay.

424
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:09,260
Scott: All right.

425
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,367
Scott: But the thing is is goes like this right?

426
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:16,121
Scott: is IBM really likes to do Apache Foundation open source stuff Like they?

427
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:25,955
Scott: they're buddy buddy with that right like IBM hired the couch DB guy to and they couch DB went through the Apache Foundation, you know IBM's all about Apache Foundation open source.

428
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:33,300
Scott: So IBM was working on this thing called harmony, which is a Java implementation, right?

429
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:34,768
Scott: that was in the Apache.

430
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:41,352
Scott: it's like the Apache Java basically and Harmony is what Android was using because Android is all Java.

431
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:41,653
Scott: eat.

432
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:47,089
Scott: if you do any Java Development for Android you're using harmony.

433
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,060
Scott: You're not using Sun Java or Oracle Java, right?

434
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,270
Scott: You're using or open JDK using harmony.

435
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,459
Rym: No one uses the open JDK yet I don't know people use it.

436
00:23:56,322 --> 00:24:11,113
Scott: So the thing is is because of this agreement with IBM and Oracle to concentrate an open JDK all the IBM employees Were working on harmony are now gonna work in open JDK instead Thus putting the Android Java in a shady place.

437
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,036
Scott: because now what they're gonna?

438
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,000
Scott: they're still using harmony.

439
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,066
Scott: So what the hell are they gonna do?

440
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:21,700
Rym: See I read a much more sinister story talking about how Oracle is now claiming to that Android's virtual machine that basically they didn't want.

441
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,640
Rym: Yeah, they're making some lawsuits because the mobile edition there was encumbered and I think there was even some cost involved.

442
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:35,730
Rym: So instead Google has Dalvik which is their Java virtual machine to run on Android and Oracle is now saying Yeah that infringes in all our patents.

443
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:36,979
Rym: We're gonna sue the fuck out of you.

444
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,898
Scott: Yeah, I know Oracle's is basically getting all evil and people are gonna have to.

445
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,008
Scott: just you know Java was already has a bunch of alternative.

446
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:48,219
Rym: apparently mobile Java actually was not included when Java was opened up.

447
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,339
Rym: Mobile Java was not open.

448
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:53,932
Rym: Google said fine We'll make our own and then we get to the problem.

449
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,118
Rym: and actually this leads into my.

450
00:24:55,199 --> 00:25:00,755
Rym: the news I want to talk about next is the patent lawsuit clusterfuck that is smartphones and cameras.

451
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,968
Scott: No, well is everything Technological.

452
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,000
Rym: Yep, but think of this.

453
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:13,360
Rym: So basically Google did something innovative and new on their own But they may or may not have infringed upon a whole bunch of ultra-broad patents that Oracle has.

454
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:17,020
Rym: So Oracle can sue them to prevent competition in the phone world.

455
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:23,620
Rym: As far as I can tell everyone who makes phones and make software has sued everyone who makes phones and make software.

456
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:28,880
Rym: There's a funny graphic online that the only flaw and it shows like all the clusters and all the lawsuit lines.

457
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:31,460
Rym: The only problem with that graphic is doesn't show all the lawsuits.

458
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,800
Scott: Usually from what I've read is the way this works right is everyone gets a ridiculous number of patents And the reason they get him is for defense, right?

459
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:48,680
Scott: It's like I'll infringe your patents and you infringe mine But if you go too far as long as we're sort of both have a ton of patents It would be mutually assured destruction, right?

460
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,549
Scott: So we're just not gonna.

461
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,499
Scott: everyone's gonna be chill.

462
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:55,080
Scott: But then it is, you know, so that no one actually goes after anyone big time.

463
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,060
Scott: They only go after when there's a slight advantage.

464
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,160
Rym: Yeah, because or when there's a really strong patent or something like that say I'm IBM in your Oracle sure say I find out.

465
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,988
Rym: Oh, they're violating like 50 of our patents.

466
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,680
Rym: Yeah, but we might be violating like 50 of theirs.

467
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,786
Rym: It'll be a giant lawsuit.

468
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,220
Rym: and when elephants fight, it's the grass that suffers.

469
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:17,134
Scott: So, yeah, the grass is the grass is suffering right now, I don't think it is.

470
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:18,960
Scott: actually I think what's gonna happen those.

471
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,913
Scott: We're gonna have a whole bunch of X org situations.

472
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,060
Scott: We're gonna library office.

473
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:23,206
Scott: There's gonna be some.

474
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:34,018
Scott: one of the Java's is gonna stand out as the Java Right and all the people are gonna go to one Java to rule them all, you know Maybe one of the MySQL forks will stand out, you know virtual box.

475
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,484
Rym: Yeah You know what's gonna stand out.

476
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:39,177
Rym: the database world post grass, you know, the new post grass has replication.

477
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:39,840
Rym: that fucking works.

478
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:45,090
Scott: Yeah, but it's still post grass Like post grass.

479
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:45,372
Rym: it's

480
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:52,700
Scott: a pain in the ass to use You know and virtual box so far is still Goes on it, but otherwise, it's still good

481
00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:25,619
Rym: I think something for more fundamentals in the works because it's interesting that the patent lawsuits in particular About a third of them as far as I can tell our hardware patents on fairly legitimate Awesome things that companies did and the other two-thirds are patents like my patent Like and a lot of them are oh, yeah this software thing on a phone On two phones networked and I think The end result of the clusterfuck of reality is that if they don't all start settling with each other or?

482
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:40,199
Rym: If we get patent trolls that go in grenade style like a company that gets one patent Or like member SEO Yeah, anyone who goes in with one patent and says we're just gonna broadside you bring it on.

483
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:47,560
Rym: Nobody wants that because when that happens Courts will start to do something about it.

484
00:27:47,881 --> 00:28:03,160
Rym: If all these lawsuits go through and none of them settle out of court the courts are gonna have to start invalidating patents on one side of the other or doing massive damages and all it does is point out more and more to even people Who don't care the obvious flaws with the entire patent system that we have today.

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,365
Scott: Well, I heard that what's gonna happen soon is they're gonna start having like public Things for patents.

486
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:09,928
Scott: They're like it's.

487
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:21,548
Scott: it's very likely that what's gonna happen is when there's a patent they're gonna put it out there before it's approved and Just people like you and me will be able to relatively easily You know with a little bit of bureaucracy.

488
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:23,797
Rym: I could go and validate my own goddamn patent.

489
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:27,888
Scott: You just basically Allow you to submit prior arts, right?

490
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:31,520
Scott: So if you can go find prior arts you can submit them eventually maybe soon.

491
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:38,539
Rym: So if I were a company that relies upon this giant patent, I would hire someone to just find prior arts.

492
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:46,272
Rym: I would also hire someone to flood the system with penises Thus preventing them from actually validating any of the real prior.

493
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:56,260
Rym: on my pens, maybe I Mean you've got some patent on like imaging a system to rebuild it with a new MAC address and dynamic DNS.

494
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,911
Rym: Yeah, and then the prior art is.

495
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,120
Rym: here's a picture of my penis.

496
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:05,399
Scott: I think the thing to just take away from this is that watch out for anything that Sun used to own that Oracle now owns because they're evil.

497
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,920
Scott: and If you're gonna use anything that is in that category, right?

498
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,760
Scott: You might want to look for like the up-and-coming replacement project and use that instead, you know?

499
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,340
Scott: Maybe use LibreOffice instead of open office or use a B word.

500
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,768
Scott: Yeah, you know that's only word processor.

501
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:24,928
Scott: Yeah, you know, but the Google Docs at least, you know, it's look for Alternatives to those things.

502
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:33,236
Scott: if you have to if you can, you know Maybe you'll be better off in long run if Oracle gets progressively more evil as time goes on.

503
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:34,540
Rym: So there's the story.

504
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,845
Rym: I only want to talk about this briefly.

505
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:49,360
Rym: but Dutch hotels under this law that may or may not be passed May have to register as ISPs and then be subject to all the regulation that ISPs are Like data regulation everything just because of the shitty way the laws are written.

506
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,568
Scott: No It's terrible.

507
00:29:50,588 --> 00:30:04,040
Rym: and now imagine that If a hotel that just offers like free Wi-Fi to the people at the hotel has to register as an ISP into all this data retention Theoretically like some store that just wants to offer free Wi-Fi has to do the same thing.

508
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:04,804
Rym: All this.

509
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:07,816
Scott: this would basically say offer free Wi-Fi at my house I have to do it too.

510
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,377
Rym: This would basically say it's illegal to offer Wi-Fi because it'll be too kind of like what I'm trying to do.

511
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:26,580
Rym: our e-commerce Properly Following the law is so much more expensive and so much more difficult than breaking the law And in fact if the more we follow the law The more likely we are to accidentally break it and be noticed than if we just never follow the law in the first place.

512
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:41,660
Rym: yeah, but I point this out one because I think that's been bothering me lately is that half the laws we have related to anything internet were written in the 80s and Literally make no sense at all in light of any modern technology.

513
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:46,279
Scott: Yeah, and - and that's why people just break the law like with piracy and such because it's like.

514
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,027
Scott: well The law is completely meaningless.

515
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,735
Scott: It's so out of the judges don't understand it.

516
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,860
Rym: Why should I understand it?

517
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,171
Scott: Why should I even bother?

518
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,899
Scott: I'm just gonna do what I know is best.

519
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,040
Rym: I mean look at how hard it is to even convince tech people that net neutrality is a problem or not a problem.

520
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:07,459
Rym: But anyway, the other thing I want to point out is that the United States does not have a monopoly on internet law.

521
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,966
Rym: bullshit This is Dutch.

522
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,212
Rym: This is not American.

523
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,117
Rym: Oh, yeah.

524
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:17,180
Scott: No by no I mean if anything the US actually has not the work anywhere near the worst internet law.

525
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,155
Scott: Look at how many places are all censoring right?

526
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:23,213
Scott: Look at how There was a. there was a URL shortener not bitly.

527
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,579
Scott: but another one that ended with ly.

528
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,826
Rym: Okay, and it was.

529
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,878
Rym: it was aimed at porn.

530
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:30,067
Scott: basically Yeah, is he a porn URL shortener?

531
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,534
Rym: only who would need that?

532
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:40,760
Scott: and because they registered In ly You are a length right, which is Libya, but I'm right qaddafi totally shut them down.

533
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:43,213
Rym: So they just was it actually qaddafi.

534
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:44,500
Scott: Well, no, but it was Libya, you know.

535
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,018
Scott: So they just lost their domain and it's like whoa bitly could just lose their domain and he any time.

536
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:52,286
Rym: because look At the same time.

537
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:56,720
Scott: I'm almost okay with remember that happened with goat C CX just the canary island.

538
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:09,890
Rym: It was ever one reason our TLDR Not TLDR our top-level domain system and the DNS in general is kind of broken in that people are just using Designations that weren't intended for those uses.

539
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,100
Rym: I mean ly was intended for Libya and we're using it because it's clever.

540
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,148
Rym: Yeah, CX was clever.

541
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:19,367
Scott: It's you know, you're not actually from the Canary Islands Yeah, and a long time.

542
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:22,399
Rym: I mean you used to actually have to be a nonprofit to get a dot org.

543
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:26,033
Rym: Yeah, daddy to you is still pretty tightly controlled.

544
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:28,020
Rym: calm, whatever men, whatever.

545
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:31,774
Rym: Yeah gov int int is the one people don't even know exists.

546
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,320
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how to get an int.

547
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,984
Rym: I don't know if I could.

548
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:34,910
Scott: yeah, I don't know either.

549
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,865
Rym: the UN has one as far as I can tell but you know It's like.

550
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:47,840
Scott: it is true that they're making a mockery of the top-level domains But at the same time it's like you think about this right bitly, you know, they need the short URL, right?

551
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:48,910
Scott: That's the whole thing.

552
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:57,908
Scott: if they added another character Like well what we should put in by a quest to have a new top-level domain that is just like Zed Mm-hmm and just that might exist.

553
00:32:57,948 --> 00:32:58,772
Rym: and that's the official.

554
00:32:58,973 --> 00:32:59,476
Rym: I don't think so.

555
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:02,951
Scott: They're usually two letters It's anyway, the other thing though is that they've already.

556
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,840
Scott: there's already all these bitly URLs.

557
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,808
Scott: So if they yoink those expire.

558
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:07,812
Rym: what do you mean?

559
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:09,860
Rym: I thought I thought they eventually got reused and expired.

560
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,644
Rym: I don't think they last forever.

561
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:11,429
Scott: I don't think so.

562
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:12,434
Rym: I don't think they last forever.

563
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:13,380
Scott: I think they last forever.

564
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,115
Scott: So if they go yoink that's like gonna ruin like this whole.

565
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,091
Scott: that's gonna like just make 404 is all over the internet.

566
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:22,916
Rym: Well that it should.

567
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:23,398
Rym: here's the thing.

568
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:33,918
Rym: It'll it should if people were smart if people were responsible internet citizens It should only affect fucking Twitter if you're using bitly on your blog to link to stuff.

569
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,620
Rym: You're stupid.

570
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,940
Scott: A lot of people are using bitly and they shouldn't play.

571
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:43,660
Scott: No The reason is not because they want to shorten the URL but because bitly provides tracking for you.

572
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:45,795
Rym: Well, you can do the tracking yourself trivially.

573
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,888
Scott: You're running Apache Yeah, but that's a lot more work than just having bitly do it.

574
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,118
Rym: Ah, I have no sympathy for plus.

575
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,527
Scott: a lot of people Remember, we're sort of weird, right?

576
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:59,523
Scott: We actually have an actual hosting where we control a true A lot of people are like.

577
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:04,500
Scott: most people are using like wordpress.com or they're using like dreamhost where you can't control shit.

578
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,147
Scott: You can't control your Apache server.

579
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:17,060
Rym: You basically put files in a folder and you can maybe But at the same time the only people who need that sort of tracking are people who are trying to sell ads anyway.

580
00:34:17,362 --> 00:34:18,551
Rym: Maybe I don't care any mind.

581
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:19,719
Rym: Okay, I doubly don't care.

582
00:34:20,202 --> 00:34:23,260
Scott: But I mean the point is that all these links on Twitter who's just gonna be broken?

583
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,214
Rym: You realize whenever I can I give raw URLs on Twitter.

584
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:31,349
Scott: We're also using bitly a lot too Yeah, so our Twitter would be broken.

585
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,060
Rym: Yeah, our Twitter would be but not our RSS feed.

586
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,159
Rym: We don't have bitly links in the feed burner.

587
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,744
Scott: No but it's you know, it's still.

588
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,712
Scott: it's pretty it's pretty bad and it's also.

589
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:46,600
Scott: a lot of people have jobs at bitly and have invested in bitly and if the domain is pretty much This place I work is the same thing.

590
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,568
Scott: I work at broadway.com at our.

591
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,280
Scott: the domain is pretty much our whole company at the same time.

592
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,005
Rym: You know, there's hope.

593
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:54,951
Rym: there's people who work at bitly and they're reliant upon.

594
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,820
Rym: they're relying upon the fact that their URL is from Libya.

595
00:34:58,303 --> 00:35:00,760
Rym: They should have known that when they got but it's too late now.

596
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,519
Rym: Actually, I went to bitly to see stuff just to try to figure out if they ever expire.

597
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,139
Rym: and For some reason the only link I see is a GeekNights link.

598
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,570
Rym: Okay, I don't know why it's showing me that on the front page.

599
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:18,876
Rym: All right, I've never.

600
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:19,840
Rym: I never used bitly.

601
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,836
Scott: All right, let me let me say check it out.

602
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:23,379
Rym: It's just weird.

603
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:25,388
Scott: Are you logged in?

604
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:26,900
Rym: No, I don't have a bitly account.

605
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,910
Scott: I'm logged in as GeekNights on bitly.

606
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,240
Rym: I'm not logged in as GeekNights on bit.

607
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,822
Scott: What does it say?

608
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:34,790
Scott: at the very top it says bitly.

609
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,508
Scott: to the right where it says sign in and sign out It says sign in or sign up.

610
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,480
Scott: It doesn't say hi GeekNights sign out.

611
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,910
Rym: No, all right, and then under shorten your long links.

612
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,034
Rym: It shows one link.

613
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:45,018
Rym: That is the GeekNights link.

614
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,385
Scott: But let me click at it and find out.

615
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:51,212
Rym: yeah, it takes us to the vanilla farms episode a1 b2 c3.

616
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:56,943
Scott: Ah Don't know What's the?

617
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:58,008
Scott: what is the bitly link?

618
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:04,722
Rym: I have a thing that turns bitly links into non bitly link see a KQCI Uh-huh.

619
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,387
Scott: I don't know where you're seeing this.

620
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,150
Scott: I'll have to look later.

621
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:08,474
Scott: All right, just keep it open.

622
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:13,160
Rym: Anyway, crazy meta aside My writing I just have little sympathy.

623
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,659
Rym: I mean This is part of the problem.

624
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:22,300
Rym: Bitly is using Libya because we really didn't think our TLD system through to handle a modern infrastructure.

625
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:30,964
Rym: But at the same time I'm not gonna be one of those You know freshmen and IT at a tech school who will you know be in class learning how DNS works like yeah This is stupid.

626
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:36,440
Rym: We should use something new and modern which is code for I don't understand it And I can't be asked to read the documentation.

627
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,788
Scott: All Right, what are their?

628
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:40,151
Scott: what are their?

629
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:40,433
Scott: tech?

630
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:41,300
Scott: news has happened.

631
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Rym: Well, there was the announcement that Google had been testing autonomous robot cars for some time now.

632
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,266
Scott: I mean that's not.

633
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:49,051
Scott: I mean there have been.

634
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:53,472
Scott: I've been when I was in high school You could watch TV and there would be shows about robot cars.

635
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:54,837
Rym: Yes, but none of them really worked.

636
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:58,625
Scott: I mean in College there were kids making robot.

637
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:03,760
Rym: Yes, but they worked in such controlled situations and didn't work at all outside of those situations.

638
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,971
Rym: They worked on empty roads that were straight.

639
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:07,940
Rym: they worked on predefined courses.

640
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:11,952
Rym: They worked in like these pathetic, you know, like proof of concepts.

641
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:23,871
Rym: Google kind of came out and they've actually you know they hire dudes apparently 15 bucks an hour to sit in the cars and just be ready to take over if they go apeshit and They're able to drive in city traffic on freeways thousands of miles.

642
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:29,268
Scott: Apparently all these even where the roads are really weird Other cars are doing really weird.

643
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,960
Rym: You know, they were testing these just downtown San Francisco.

644
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:35,358
Scott: All right, the driving's not too bad there it is is it?

645
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:35,699
Scott: yeah?

646
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:38,993
Scott: But I mean like, you know, what if other cars do weird stuff?

647
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,118
Scott: the Google car still works.

648
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:50,540
Rym: supposedly They do and all this time only one was involved in an accident for the many thousand whatever miles they've driven and that accident It was stopped at a red light and someone rear-ended it.

649
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:51,303
Scott: I mean like.

650
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:54,780
Scott: what if like the road is just really weird where you know, this is out west.

651
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,511
Scott: I mean, how would it do on an East Road right East Coast?

652
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,820
Scott: The roads are old and very weird out west.

653
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,050
Scott: They're a lot more grid like and you know easy to pattern.

654
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,117
Rym: San Francisco's pretty shitty to drive in.

655
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:11,840
Scott: from all the tell I've seen on the I mean, maybe they can deal with other cars But they're still not dealing with weird northeast old roads not yet.

656
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,226
Rym: but the point is that what Google showed and demonstrated at least is Leaps and bounds beyond.

657
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,297
Rym: the last time there was big news about robot cars.

658
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:20,880
Scott: that is true.

659
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:29,240
Rym: And I think within our lifetime you and me we will see Autonomous or at least semi autonomous robot cars on the streets for real.

660
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,080
Rym: Yes, which will be great when we're old because then I don't have to deal with the problem of I'm too old to drive safely.

661
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:39,540
Scott: And yeah It'd be great now cuz I could go somewhere without having anyone have to drive.

662
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,155
Scott: We can have four seats facing the middle and play board game.

663
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:49,893
Rym: if I had a robot car I would pay whatever it took to own a car and have it parked in this building and every con I just get in the car and say take me to Otakon.

664
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:50,516
Rym: That's right.

665
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:51,380
Rym: Maybe not Otakon.

666
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,325
Rym: Take me to PAX.

667
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,097
Scott: I would take you to Seattle when you wanted to go to Boston.

668
00:38:56,237 --> 00:39:01,011
Rym: Yeah Course maybe it'll be like ex-driver.

669
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:06,974
Scott: Yeah, robot cars are awesome And really any Luddites just need to STFU right if anyone's like.

670
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,438
Scott: no again, I don't trust it.

671
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,040
Scott: It's dangerous.

672
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,460
Scott: It's like it's not any more dangerous than your shitty driving.

673
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:17,098
Scott: I think human error is way more dangerous than even flawed computers.

674
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:23,300
Rym: two points One of the biggest killers of humans in the world today at least world is car accidents.

675
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:33,354
Rym: Yeah, and to think about the fuel economy of robot cars that can autonomously form road trains on the freeway Yeah, and the fact that you know, they don't drive like morons.

676
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,580
Scott: everyone has robot cars.

677
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,702
Scott: There'll be a lot less traffic because the cars will just be like an inch from each other all going at the maximum possible Speed.

678
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:42,070
Rym: and here, you know mass transit works.

679
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:50,334
Rym: in very dense centers like in New York City Our subway system works because all the jobs are in one place and all the people are in a couple of places and the subways Just work.

680
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,419
Rym: Mass transit despite the dreams of a lot of people who want it to be is not feasible in most of the country

681
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,495
Scott: unless Everyone moves which they should yeah

682
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,124
Rym: But it won't be ever

683
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:04,420
Scott: unless every state becomes a country and then all the states that aren't feasible will go bankrupt.

684
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:05,605
Rym: I don't have to leave them.

685
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:09,520
Rym: mass transit like Detroit doesn't service even in like New York mass trans.

686
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,143
Rym: It's awesome.

687
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:14,240
Rym: Unless you want to go a couple of miles to the left or right of where the mass transit goes.

688
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:19,160
Scott: Yeah There are certain places like you just can't get right like if I had to go to the UPS of the FedEx in mass.

689
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:26,300
Scott: Like if you don't drive there like there is a subway stop, but it's not close and the bus goes there.

690
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,203
Scott: But it's a shitty.

691
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:29,551
Scott: you got to take like two or three buses and it's real.

692
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:30,294
Scott: I just bike there.

693
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:30,956
Scott: It's way easier.

694
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:34,670
Scott: macadamia Mean macadamia gazebo on the bus.

695
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:40,828
Rym: Yeah the bus bus bus But even more The like.

696
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:40,990
Rym: what?

697
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,737
Rym: I want to go skiing.

698
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,971
Rym: Who would ever make a train that goes to Hunter Mountain?

699
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:45,734
Scott: nobody.

700
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,120
Rym: so I got to take the bus.

701
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:48,671
Rym: You know what the bus sucks.

702
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:52,993
Rym: every time I've been to Hunter Mountain I will see that bus pull up after I've been skiing for like an hour.

703
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:54,700
Scott: Yeah, it just gets you there late.

704
00:40:55,062 --> 00:41:03,240
Rym: Yeah, I hate that shit and it's like 80 bucks a person what it's cheaper If I'm going with more than one other person it is cheaper to rent a car for the entire weekend.

705
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,123
Rym: That is to take.

706
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:07,014
Scott: that car is a ripoff and that's still cheaper.

707
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,720
Rym: Yeah zip car is not that bad.

708
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,604
Rym: I'm thinking about getting it.

709
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,580
Scott: Yeah, maybe I would get if it was less money.

710
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,880
Scott: It's still way too much money because like I wouldn't use it most of the time and you paying even if you're not using.

711
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,440
Rym: I looked into it actually for how much I rent cars.

712
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:23,120
Rym: It would be useful because when I go skiing I have to rent a car.

713
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,153
Rym: I have to run a car like five times every winter.

714
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:26,199
Rym: It's already used worth it?

715
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,869
Scott: Yeah, I don't I wouldn't use it that much.

716
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,774
Rym: Yeah, cuz you don't go skiing.

717
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:29,920
Scott: I would use it a lot less.

718
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:33,839
Rym: I also might use it to go to like ConnectiCon rather than I don't know what we're gonna do.

719
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,170
Scott: Yeah, that's like that's when I would use it which is like what when one's twice a year, you know, it's not a lot Right.

720
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:51,404
Rym: Yeah Anyway, the other thing is that in general if we had robot cars It solves so many societal problems that you wouldn't even think about like getting kids to school and dealing with buses And you

721
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,504
Scott: just have the kids get in the car and you can say car go to school Yeah,

722
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,289
Rym: and old and

723
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,779
Scott: then the car would just drive itself home.

724
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,466
Rym: We don't need taxis anymore.

725
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:03,020
Scott: Maybe robot taxis the driver on all the taxi workers would be out of work.

726
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:03,703
Rym: That's fine.

727
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:06,075
Scott: All the any bridge any chauffeur would be out of work.

728
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:17,120
Scott: Yeah now I feel like really rich people would demand to have human Robots anyway only really old people who didn't trust the robot cars and we just had to make human driving on roads illegal.

729
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:22,000
Scott: I guess I'm just and only only human drivers and races and other situations like that.

730
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,720
Rym: Well, I think there'll be a transition where what we'd have to do is just phase in the robot cars.

731
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:27,427
Scott: That's the one the new engines got.

732
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:29,597
Scott: the Jetsons had flying cars that you drove.

733
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:30,079
Scott: It's like what?

734
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,927
Scott: X over had non flying cars.

735
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:36,320
Rym: I saw Elroy get into a car in one episode and tell it to go to school.

736
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,078
Rym: They just drove him there.

737
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,860
Scott: Yeah, it was all but most of the time George just is sitting into the stick and he's wiggling it back and forth.

738
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,550
Rym: You know, he wasn't just playing like a game cuz he didn't see the guy.

739
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,032
Scott: I don't know.

740
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:46,256
Rym: It was in his brain.

741
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,368
Rym: maybe It's not like he was staring.

742
00:42:49,388 --> 00:42:53,994
Rym: He's just going left right left right left friend Like everyone in old movies with that back projection is always Larry's.

743
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,160
Scott: the Jetsons had flying cars.

744
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,031
Scott: They would still line up in traffic when they could just gone out.

745
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:00,400
Scott: There's different ways to directly to the destination.

746
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:06,036
Rym: There was even traffic in the fifth element, I know at least that made sense.

747
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:07,180
Rym: there were just so many cars.

748
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,240
Scott: Yeah, they actually cars fucking everywhere.

749
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,601
Rym: I'm just.

750
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,648
Rym: I'm really excited about robot cars.

751
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:17,507
Rym: if if there was anything that I want from science other than Immortality and perfect eternal.

752
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:29,988
Scott: I think robot cars are the most convenient awesome and drastic Improvement to everyday life that is feasible in the near either on the near future in the industrialized world because there are parts of the world Where clean water is a revolution.

753
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:35,632
Scott: Yeah, I mean another related thing right is, you know I've always said I would get a tattoo if it was like digital like just a race.

754
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:37,720
Rym: Oh digital ink tattoo ink.

755
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,960
Scott: There's strides in that as somebody invented basically like LED tattoo.

756
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,840
Scott: So you implant this LED grid and then you can light it up in different colors and so I would get that.

757
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,827
Scott: I would get it under three conditions.

758
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,580
Scott: condition number one if I could turn off all the lights and it'd be invisible.

759
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:57,252
Scott: Condition number two, I could easily program it to do whatever.

760
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:57,875
Rym: condition three.

761
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:58,840
Rym: It doesn't cause cancer.

762
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:01,515
Scott: Well, I mean, I mean, it's just a grid or I have lights.

763
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,420
Scott: It's not gonna be cancer.

764
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,920
Rym: Never know my just you might get an infection now, you'd be surprised how much stuff leeches out of stuff.

765
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,069
Rym: Oh, that's true, especially in the human body.

766
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:12,322
Scott: Yeah, I mean if there's any pain or any sort of hazards I don't want it.

767
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:15,555
Scott: but condition three is what's the battery situation with that?

768
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,650
Scott: Yeah got a battery in your ear Yeah, and you to replace the battery.

769
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:19,496
Scott: if that, you know, it's like.

770
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:22,940
Rym: fuck that, you know You charge it with induction maybe but be a way to do it.

771
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,118
Scott: But if but if it has if it had all of the if did none of those caveats, I'll get it.

772
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:32,908
Rym: If you lottie know what you got to get is the thing where you can just wave your hand and your hand as the LEDs in it.

773
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,542
Rym: Yeah All right.

774
00:44:35,862 --> 00:44:36,264
Rym: All right.

775
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,871
Rym: So cuz Scott doesn't even have any tech news.

776
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:43,050
Rym: There's this dude and this is a common problem That's been around for a long time.

777
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,179
Rym: This is not a new story.

778
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:47,639
Rym: This guy is just a new story and that is calling attention to it.

779
00:44:48,161 --> 00:45:00,520
Rym: Dude is smart has a smartphone goes to use book sales scans is BNS Automatically looks on Amazon to see if the books are worth money or not Buys all the books that are way underpriced sells them on Amazon.

780
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,130
Scott: What I read is he's actually used bookstore owner, right?

781
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,640
Scott: So he goes to you know, he doesn't go to used bookstores.

782
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,240
Scott: He goes to like, you know second-hand stores and other places that books aren't their primary thing that they can tag sale.

783
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,389
Rym: You're talking about Michael Savitt's the guy.

784
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,252
Scott: that's the guy.

785
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:18,920
Rym: there's a bunch more people involved in this this story.

786
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:27,673
Scott: But I mean this one guy got most the internet attention cuz he goes around and he's trying to buy books to sell in his Used bookstore and he has like a database of the used books.

787
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:28,920
Scott: cuz he's used bookstore owner.

788
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:37,534
Scott: So he checks the value in his little database with his smartphone And if he sees that the book is underpriced he buys it and then sells it in his used bookstore.

789
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,520
Rym: now, here's the problem.

790
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,000
Rym: First and weirdly I looked around on the internet and even slashdot.

791
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:50,200
Rym: I'd say the majority of the people posting are totally against this guy and are totally for the bookstores banning him.

792
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:52,080
Rym: What the fuck most of slash jobs?

793
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,124
Rym: Yes, last shot.

794
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,691
Rym: People are like fuck this guy.

795
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,394
Rym: What the fuck?

796
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,860
Rym: He's being a jerk to the bookstore.

797
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,770
Rym: He's undercutting all the competition.

798
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:03,609
Rym: Like I can't imagine Called business isn't slash.

799
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:04,774
Scott: It's usually super live.

800
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:05,960
Rym: It's not even called business.

801
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:09,693
Rym: It's called being smart and using technology to do something better.

802
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,600
Rym: notice how the article says arbitrage.

803
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:17,376
Rym: You know what arbitrage is if there is someone selling something and someone else buying something and their prices are crossed.

804
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:22,138
Rym: as in someone will buy Something for more than someone else is selling it and they just haven't met each other.

805
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:26,180
Rym: Arbitrage is when you buy it from person a and sell it to person B and pocket the difference.

806
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,560
Rym: Yep, and arbitrage is a very important thing in the stock market.

807
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:34,910
Rym: That's how you're able to trade even if no one's buying right now In in pretty much any time.

808
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,775
Rym: there's an imbalance.

809
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:36,499
Rym: in any market.

810
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,500
Rym: Arbitrage is when someone takes it upon themselves to balance that out.

811
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:46,453
Scott: but what will happen right is right now we have a situation where there's a few smart people and a bunch of stupid people in every market.

812
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:52,392
Scott: if we have a ton of Arbitrage in all different markets then all prices converge on real price.

813
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:59,100
Scott: Yeah, but basically the problem is that real price I think is gonna ruin our economy and make every all even more unemployment and porn.

814
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:03,780
Rym: Definitely what I think it's going to do is use bookstores will just disappear but they're gonna disappear.

815
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,279
Rym: Anyway, Amazon wins Kindle wins.

816
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:13,120
Rym: Yeah, use bookstores only existed like the beach pretty much and even then most used bookstore owners don't use technology for shit.

817
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:23,328
Rym: I never see barcodes or barcode scanners or even usually they've got that one like 486 that their grandkids set up for him 20 years ago, maybe Ten years ago.

818
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,480
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's the same in a lot of industries.

819
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:31,408
Scott: I was at this little hacker meetup and this guy he wasn't that technological He's mostly a business guy, right?

820
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,660
Scott: And apparently his family owns liquor stores, right?

821
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,316
Scott: So he knew how to program like a palm pilot and he programmed.

822
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,180
Scott: he went to business school.

823
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:47,160
Scott: So he knew these business algorithms to figure out like how much inventory you should buy like what you should order You know and he knows he really knows how to figure out what you should order.

824
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:53,100
Scott: So he wrote a palm pilot program where you just keep the inventory and your sales on this palm pilot.

825
00:47:53,601 --> 00:48:00,320
Scott: Not even a point-of-sale system doesn't even have that right because all his family's liquor stores are so technologically inept.

826
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:06,854
Scott: Even this shitty palm pilot app helps them like make better orders and not buy some alcohol.

827
00:48:06,874 --> 00:48:12,060
Scott: that's gonna sit on the shelf and Order enough of what's gonna sell and have the price be correct, you know.

828
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,060
Scott: And it's like imagine if they had a point-of-sale system and an actual computer instead of just this palm pilot thing.

829
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,611
Scott: This guy wrote.

830
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:22,580
Rym: You could blow away all the liquor stores in town or even use bookstores.

831
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,300
Rym: You know correlate like the guy at the beach right that used bookstore.

832
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:32,627
Rym: What if he just correlated like what sold and when it sold what authors were popular and you know The demographic of like a girl bought this.

833
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,253
Scott: a guy bought that right?

834
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:36,220
Scott: It's how many girls, you know general age.

835
00:48:36,441 --> 00:48:37,869
Scott: You just look at the person right?

836
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,227
Scott: You could have cameras in your store perfectly legal You can.

837
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:45,699
Scott: just you know you could get all kinds of crazy data from that and use it to vastly improve your sales.

838
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,800
Scott: and then Like you could also if books aren't selling you can look on Amazon.

839
00:48:49,941 --> 00:48:54,259
Scott: You can try to sell them on Amazon if no one's buying them in the store, you know do stuff like that.

840
00:48:54,874 --> 00:49:05,459
Rym: Yeah The funny thing is I've run into this before I got kicked out of a Best Buy once when I was in high school Because I was shopping for something and I actually pulled out a camera and took a picture.

841
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,460
Rym: now You're not supposed to do that technically so I got kicked out.

842
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,238
Rym: But I got kicked out from another Best Buy when I did it with a pen and paper.

843
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:17,400
Rym: instead I was just writing down the prices of the things I was gonna buy and then going around other stores and seeing where it was Jeepist and they kick you out.

844
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,495
Rym: I was writing down prices and they asked me to leave.

845
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:24,594
Rym: Wow And it's fairly common store and especially now that people have some like iPhones.

846
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:26,079
Rym: they're taking pictures or like.

847
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,405
Scott: well They're scanning the barcodes.

848
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:30,520
Rym: Yes, take pictures of the barcodes and then looking on you know, there's apps.

849
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,340
Rym: They'll just tell you here's what this cost on Amazon.

850
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:39,629
Rym: Yeah, and I've gotten a lot of no one can kick me out of like an anime dealers room But a lot of people have had harsh words for me.

851
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:48,946
Rym: when I stand at a guy's booth and I pick up like princess Tutu it's like 40 bucks and I just hold it in my hand and I hold my phone and I type in princess tutu And I see it's 30 bucks in Amazon.

852
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:50,111
Rym: I put it back down and walk away.

853
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:50,734
Scott: Mm-hmm.

854
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,762
Rym: I Was just what.

855
00:49:52,923 --> 00:50:01,976
Scott: as the guy gets that's that's the you know, I mean you can charge a slight premium for you know Sell it getting it now, right and you can get away with that.

856
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:02,820
Scott: For example, right?

857
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,242
Scott: I bought it.

858
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,352
Scott: I had to buy a new DS cuz the other one was stolen.

859
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:06,900
Scott: I bought it in Best Buy.

860
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,268
Scott: I didn't show my receipt at the door.

861
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:09,354
Scott: I did the no thanks trick.

862
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,501
Rym: Yeah, it worked Didn't?

863
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,414
Rym: they pause for a second like what and they just walk out?

864
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:13,991
Scott: I didn't even look at him I just walked out.

865
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,182
Rym: You gotta say no Thanks, like.

866
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:18,311
Rym: you're totally sincere and they'll pause and just walk past him whatever.

867
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:21,600
Scott: so, you know, it's the same price in Amazon.

868
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,900
Scott: Apparently wheeze and Xbox 360s are also the same price in Amazon as they are in the store.

869
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,389
Rym: So even my life camera.

870
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,060
Rym: I was gonna you know, I was gonna buy this webcam.

871
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:31,972
Rym: I go to Best Buy I see the price I go on Amazon.

872
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:32,796
Rym: I see it's the same.

873
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:33,679
Rym: So I just bought it.

874
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:35,620
Scott: Yeah, that's you know, it'll happen.

875
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:40,860
Scott: Most of the time Amazon is gonna be cheaper right and most of the time Best Buy is gonna over.

876
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,005
Scott: But here's the final problem.

877
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:42,888
Scott: memory cards like.

878
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:45,800
Scott: I need a new memory card, you know a micro SD card.

879
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,424
Scott: so I go.

880
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:51,604
Scott: and of course Best Buy is like 40 bucks and Amazon's like $10.

881
00:50:51,604 --> 00:50:59,820
Rym: But here's the amazing thing Anyone I can see why store owners physical brick-and-mortar store owners are against people doing this.

882
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:04,140
Rym: That is self-interest and I can understand that if you don't own a store.

883
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:12,855
Scott: But I mean wouldn't it just be better if you were the owning the store if you just Competed and then one it's like, you know, because currently people don't do this by and large.

884
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:14,300
Rym: so they win by not competing.

885
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:15,859
Rym: I mean think about how many people buy an.

886
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,280
Scott: They make more money ripping off all those customers and just getting rid of a few smart customers and not getting their business at all.

887
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,751
Rym: Oh source hate smart customers.

888
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:25,920
Rym: They'd rather us just not shop there.

889
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:37,920
Rym: Uh-huh, kind of like how TV networks will often, you know, if the demographic if a show is popular But not with the right advertising demographic They'll just take it Even if the show is very popular because they don't make money from the popularity of the show.

890
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:41,149
Rym: They make money from the advertisers and the advertisers want the.

891
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:44,700
Rym: you know, the dream demographic 20 to 30 something affluent white dudes.

892
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:47,946
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean or you know It depends to like if you're.

893
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:56,455
Scott: if you're advertising like prescription drug plans you advertise people CBS during the daytime when the old people are watching, you know It's like they.

894
00:51:56,475 --> 00:51:56,556
Scott: it's.

895
00:51:56,657 --> 00:52:08,982
Scott: you know If a show doesn't have a particular demographic then even if the even if the audience is very large if you're not advertising something that has a broad audience that's just generic pop culture then It's cute.

896
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:13,040
Scott: You're not gonna get that many, you know eyeballs that you want cuz like, okay, I'm gonna advertise.

897
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:19,313
Scott: You know Some like toys and I'm gonna advertise the toys on HBO.

898
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,460
Scott: HBO doesn't have commercials, but you get the point, right?

899
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,459
Scott: It's like no kids are watching that dude Even if a billion people are watching it.

900
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,809
Scott: Advertising he-man is not gonna work in that spot.

901
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:32,337
Rym: There was a time when cable didn't have commercials.

902
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:33,080
Scott: That's true.

903
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:36,278
Scott: So, I mean, you know, it's it might want to show that.

904
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:43,732
Scott: okay We want a show where even if only a million people are watching even if only a few thousand people are watching They're all in the same demographic or mostly.

905
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:45,580
Scott: so our advertising be very effective.

906
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:50,637
Rym: So my point is thus I can understand why store owners are against this sort of thing.

907
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,026
Rym: Fuck them But I understand where they're coming from.

908
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:54,773
Rym: anyone who's not own a store.

909
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:55,857
Rym: I can.

910
00:52:55,957 --> 00:53:07,243
Rym: there is no possible rational argument you can make against someone using extent information that is publicly available on their smartphone to figure out if a deal in a store is a good Deal or not.

911
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:07,767
Rym: I don't know.

912
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:08,371
Scott: there it's.

913
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,643
Scott: it's weird the attitudes I see people have.

914
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:16,006
Scott: I've seen different attitudes such as there are people who feel charitable towards the store owners Like especially.

915
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,740
Scott: I see this a lot with comic people, right?

916
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:18,122
Scott: It's like.

917
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:19,268
Scott: I'm like, why do you?

918
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:21,600
Scott: why don't you just pre-order and get the crazy discount?

919
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,572
Scott: They're like, oh because I'm supporting the store.

920
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:27,299
Scott: It's like Just listen to the not a charity episode.

921
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,353
Rym: Here's a quote from one of the one of the haters on slash dot.

922
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:34,688
Rym: and now that I'm looking at the article again Luckily all the haters have for every hater.

923
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:36,894
Rym: There's two responders saying what the fuck's wrong with you.

924
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:42,021
Rym: So slash dot dot respect plus plus Quote.

925
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:45,016
Rym: sure you can go through all those second-hand bookstores and strip them of anything.

926
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:45,760
Rym: They'll make a profit.

927
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:49,620
Rym: It makes the store less interesting for the rest of us who actually want to read the books we find.

928
00:53:50,124 --> 00:53:56,360
Rym: I like the search which may turn up treasure I recognize or may turn up something obscure that I but virtually nobody else wants to read.

929
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:58,486
Scott: You can just do that on the internet.

930
00:53:58,546 --> 00:53:59,249
Rym: Yeah, fuck you.

931
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,624
Scott: Yeah, it's like I Think a lot of it is.

932
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:02,965
Scott: it's.

933
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,851
Scott: it's like feelings and nostalgia.

934
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:09,159
Scott: Like people say oh, I like to hold it in my hands It's like that's a legitimate thing.

935
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:19,360
Rym: But to then say therefore you smart person should use your smartphone to find a smart price Because then this if you TV take it to the logical extreme the store won't exist anymore.

936
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:20,640
Scott: They won't be able to go there anymore.

937
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,449
Rym: Yeah, but the store only exists because there's so many stupid people.

938
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:24,573
Rym: It's the nostalgia.

939
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:27,847
Rym: People are not the majority of the market either They're the minority.

940
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:28,611
Rym: We're the minority.

941
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:30,039
Rym: the majority just doesn't know better.

942
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:35,667
Rym: When I every time I'm in a Best Buy or a surgical circuit city or a store like that I guess not Circuit City anymore.

943
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,114
Scott: That was a long time ago.

944
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:37,978
Scott: I forgot they existed.

945
00:54:38,018 --> 00:54:40,026
Rym: remember Well, I guess FYE is still around.

946
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,614
Scott: media play media play was the best.

947
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:47,616
Scott: media play was the best one Because that's the real media play cuz actually competed with the internet.

948
00:54:47,636 --> 00:54:48,420
Scott: That's why they're out of business.

949
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:52,020
Rym: Yeah, media play was the store that sold what the internet now sells.

950
00:54:52,301 --> 00:55:01,935
Rym: Yeah, media play was great when I couldn't buy stuff on the internet and sure was Plus that one media play in Rochester is one of the only Profitable ones toward the end as far as I could tell and it actually sir.

951
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:02,779
Scott: I bought my GameCube.

952
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:03,764
Scott: there They serve nerds.

953
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:08,085
Scott: Well, they're like, this is our IT could pre-order stuff easily You know you would.

954
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,297
Scott: I'll bet that that you would actually get the stuff you pre-ordered.

955
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:13,226
Scott: if you pre-ordered something You have like a pre-order bonus.

956
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,131
Scott: You'd get the bonus.

957
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:15,740
Scott: I had D&D books.

958
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:23,389
Rym: They had I will bet money that that media play if media play had gone under and somehow that media play had been exempt from The bankruptcy could have stuck around.

959
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:25,940
Rym: maybe they would had to get rid of all those CDs.

960
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,927
Scott: They had a huge music section and a whole bunch of other crap They were mandated to have.

961
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:31,012
Rym: that cuz that never sold that.

962
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:34,368
Rym: the manager herself said that yeah This anime shit is like half our money.

963
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:35,833
Scott: Yeah, they sell anime shit.

964
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:37,420
Scott: They had you know, some nerdy books.

965
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:39,251
Scott: You know that kind of thing whatever.

966
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:48,360
Rym: but anyway I I don't know what to do about this because stores are literally like yelling at people and like making people leave or just scan.

967
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,905
Scott: If anyone yells at me, I'll just leave I'll be like fine no money for you I'll never come back here.

968
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,000
Scott: And in fact, I'm telling everyone else never come back.

969
00:55:54,042 --> 00:56:03,239
Rym: Yeah At least I do a public service whenever I'm in a Best Buy and I I love the look on Best Buy employees faces cuz they Work there, but they don't own Best Buy's They don't really care.

970
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:15,980
Rym: But they're still annoyed a little bit when you know I'm standing looking at something and a guy's like Asking him a question and I just kind of look at Amazon to see what it really cost and I turn and say yeah You can buy that exact same thing on Amazon for like 40 bucks less and then just walk away.

971
00:56:16,382 --> 00:56:17,506
Scott: Yeah, I love doing that.

972
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,619
Rym: one Best Guy guy was like, yeah, but you won't get the extended warranty.

973
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,840
Scott: Actually if you buy it with the American Express card you will get an extra warranty on time.

974
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:31,520
Rym: If everyone knew that that benefit would go away.

975
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:33,749
Rym: I think it's only there because most people don't know all those.

976
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,324
Scott: the reason all those part of the reason all those benefits exist is No one knows about them.

977
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:37,705
Rym: Yeah.

978
00:56:38,107 --> 00:56:38,388
Rym: Yeah.

979
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:41,580
Rym: So do you have anything cuz I got one more thing I want to talk about.

980
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,380
Scott: Alright, let's just get it over with cuz I'm way hungry and I'm gonna make some awesome dinner.

981
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,614
Rym: Alright, there's a slash shot article on like the 12th.

982
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,322
Scott: So like last week on a Tuesday We haven't done tech stuff in a long time So that's plenty.

983
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:56,520
Rym: and it basically said that people are stupid with their passwords online and it made all these kind of disparaging remarks.

984
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,352
Rym: But yeah, the stupid users like they use passwords incorrectly and I read the.

985
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,700
Scott: I think the biggest problem is simply that it's it.

986
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,292
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the people passwords people make.

987
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:07,060
Scott: I mean except for the people who make a password.

988
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,010
Scott: That's like password or admin or ABC 123.

989
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,154
Rym: You don't need a password.

990
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,800
Rym: That's 16 like high ASCII.

991
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:19,200
Scott: It helps to have something that's a little bit complicated likes and something that's something that no one you know can figure out.

992
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:28,220
Scott: Right, a lot of people will make something like the name of their dog, but now it's like, okay great That's you know, no one's gonna figure it out some stranger, but everyone you know can figure it out.

993
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:33,840
Scott: So you wonder you know most of the time when you hacks, you know Some people talk about oh you hacked my myspace.

994
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:37,600
Scott: It's cuz he figured out your password cuz he knows you personally, you know?

995
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,616
Scott: Or they look at your profile and they figure out your password from your profile

996
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:41,641
Rym: or keylogger But

997
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:51,380
Scott: or keyloggers, you know, but that's that's much more rare As long as your password isn't something personally that someone can figure out about you if they know you and it's not something completely stupid.

998
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:55,370
Scott: The biggest problem is people tell people their passwords.

999
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:59,340
Scott: Don't tell anybody don't tell your your wife don't tell nobody.

1000
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,947
Rym: I don't think that's the biggest problem anymore.

1001
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:02,132
Rym: That is a huge problem.

1002
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:09,540
Rym: But reading this article I realized that one Everyone recommends like have a huge hard-to-remember password that's unique to every site you visit.

1003
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:13,080
Rym: No have like two throwaway passwords for all the throwaway bullshit sites.

1004
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:21,520
Rym: The only things that actually need a password that is actually difficult are your bank Yeah, and any financial stuff like you have Scott trade account or something?

1005
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:30,180
Rym: But more important than that your goddamn email address because if you Compromise someone's email address you can compromise every other account they've got in the world.

1006
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,955
Rym: Yeah Cuz all you have to do is search through their email figure out the username go reset the password Get the new password from their email.

1007
00:58:37,116 --> 00:58:44,280
Scott: They're fucked Yeah, but the thing is if let's say someone compromises your Facebook if you still have your email you can recover your face.

1008
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,000
Rym: But yeah, but if you if someone compromises your email you are so fucked.

1009
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:51,690
Rym: Yeah, mail is probably the most if you have to rank all your passwords.

1010
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:55,000
Rym: I think email is actually number one in this world today.

1011
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:58,440
Rym: Oh, yeah, unless you are a lot of you doesn't do anything important on the internet.

1012
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,660
Scott: See I've been using super gen pass and the way super gen pass works is one of those domain hash salt thingies.

1013
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:08,520
Scott: So what basically the way it works is you have one password that you remember and make it a good one, right?

1014
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,540
Scott: Because if but what happens is you go to a website.

1015
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,868
Scott: Let's say I go to a website for American Express.

1016
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:21,540
Scott: it basically takes the American Express comm domain Combines it with my master password and generates a new password.

1017
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,080
Scott: That's crazy complicated and it uses that as the password for the site.

1018
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:35,789
Scott: So what I do is I just type in the one password that I remember and then I go to any website and I click the super gen pass thing and Automatically spits out the password for that site.

1019
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,917
Scott: So I have a different password for every frickin website.

1020
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:38,820
Scott: That's crazy complicated.

1021
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,274
Scott: I don't even know what most of them are, but I don't have to remember all of them.

1022
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:43,680
Scott: and super gen pass.

1023
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:49,980
Scott: You know, you normally would be like whoa What a super gen pass disappears, but super gen pass is a little bit of JavaScript and I've got it saved.

1024
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:51,968
Scott: So I have it forever in case anything happens.

1025
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:54,017
Scott: and they have a mobile site and they've got it all.

1026
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:55,222
Scott: it's all set up It's all good.

1027
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:56,828
Rym: Now a poor way to go.

1028
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,551
Rym: It's not.

1029
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:58,956
Scott: it's not the best solution.

1030
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:03,519
Scott: There's new a better solution I'm gonna switch to and the better solution is a password card.

1031
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:14,656
Scott: This is a website you go to and you print out a password card and it generates one randomly and it's basically just this grid Of random symbols and each row and column has a symbol on it identifying it.

1032
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:20,560
Scott: so you could just be like, alright I'll remember that the first eight symbols in the dollar sign column are my bank.

1033
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:23,280
Scott: So you look and there's a password right there for you.

1034
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:28,939
Scott: But if you lose the card someone looks at and they go Uh, it's just a card with a bunch of crazy symbols on it doesn't help them at all.

1035
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:38,040
Rym: And even you know brute-forcing is not an issue anymore because every site that's worth anything After you try three or four times it slows you down or locks you out or something.

1036
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:39,940
Scott: Well, I mean a brute-forcing from that angle.

1037
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:48,540
Scott: But even then if your passwords are hashed and salted in the database as someone who has access to the database So if it's an inside job, it's still gonna be really hard for them to get your password.

1038
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:57,727
Rym: Uh, unless it's a shady like, you know crappy for a lot of places do not salt and hash the password properly Even if you do nothing else.

1039
01:00:57,907 --> 01:01:03,943
Rym: if you just use like the lowest goddamn level Apache like HT access and HT password You're fine.

1040
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,287
Scott: Well, mostly fine.

1041
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:06,370
Rym: Well, you're fine enough.

1042
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,537
Scott: Yeah, mostly not completely.

1043
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:12,240
Scott: you're fine for morons But still they're hacker people who just be like they'll break that so fast.

1044
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:13,685
Rym: They have to break in.

1045
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:16,836
Rym: usually they have to at least break Apache right but it's easy to do that.

1046
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:19,245
Scott: if someone's who someone Who's not doing stuff properly?

1047
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:20,229
Scott: It's already they're all.

1048
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:21,975
Scott: their whole thing is gonna be easy to destroy.

1049
01:01:21,995 --> 01:01:25,148
Scott: true true Yeah, they're gonna have holes all over.

1050
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:25,972
Rym: actually what I want.

1051
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,599
Scott: You're either Swiss cheese or your Fort.

1052
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:28,966
Scott: not There isn't a lot of in between.

1053
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:35,160
Rym: I have my Yuba key and I have an open ID And I use that for every site that takes it which currently is fucking nothing.

1054
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,891
Scott: I'll actually a lot of sites use open ID.

1055
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:43,226
Rym: They're just not sites that you use Yeah, but nothing that I use except uh, well nothing now Yeah, no, but you know.

1056
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:46,539
Scott: if thing about Yuba key and other, you know, is that?

1057
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:55,723
Scott: If you're making sites for yourself your internal stuff at a company or like our own GeekNights stuff You can make it use The UV.

1058
01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:57,272
Rym: well open ID is interesting because it's not.

1059
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:58,700
Scott: you have your own WordPress blog.

1060
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,492
Scott: You can install the Yuba key plug-in open IDs or something like open ID.

1061
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:04,860
Rym: not to plug open ID because it does have its problems.

1062
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:07,108
Rym: Not to say that I promise is open idea.

1063
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,353
Rym: Nothing fucking uses it.

1064
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:12,072
Scott: every the lot of stuff uses it Not enough stuff stack overflow.

1065
01:02:12,092 --> 01:02:13,420
Rym: Yeah, and I use it for that.

1066
01:02:13,721 --> 01:02:17,440
Scott: I think the thing is that most sites right are actually open ID providers.

1067
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:26,231
Scott: So like you get you know, Google your Google account is an open ID and your Facebook account is an open ID But you can't use your open ID from Google to log into Facebook.

1068
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:27,837
Rym: Yep, and I want a universal one.

1069
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,246
Scott: They're not consumers They're just they're their providers.

1070
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:34,163
Rym: Also, like maybe a different company could do it better or different open version or whatever There's.

1071
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,946
Rym: there's different ways to go about it But with something like open ID.

1072
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:43,220
Rym: the primary benefit of it at least in my opinion is proof of identity more so than authentication.

1073
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:52,080
Rym: Yeah, it's the ability to say look I made this post and I am me Yeah, or I am X this and I was you know, oh I can prove later that that was me.

1074
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,308
Scott: Well, oh off is helping with that a bit.

1075
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:56,436
Scott: But oh off is not the same thing as open ID.

1076
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:57,540
Scott: people get them confused a lot.

1077
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,640
Scott: They're actually completely separate.

1078
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:06,382
Scott: What Oh off is is is when I go to say your website and your website is some integration with Facebook Right.

1079
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:11,460
Scott: I mean I could use you know, Oh open ID to log into your website with Facebook.

1080
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:18,760
Scott: But Oh off is basically I give you permission on Facebook to do stuff with my Facebook account, right?

1081
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,567
Scott: It's it's the other direction, right?

1082
01:03:20,888 --> 01:03:24,744
Scott: So if I want to log into rims website with Facebook That's open ID.

1083
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:30,047
Scott: if I want to give Rym the ability to do stuff to my Facebook Then that's Oh off right?

1084
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:32,356
Scott: There's two things going on there and people.

1085
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:34,384
Scott: people are not, you know Always up on that.

1086
01:03:34,505 --> 01:03:38,160
Rym: so something Google's been doing lately my last thing and Facebook is doing it now, too.

1087
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,148
Rym: But Facebook introduced their one-time passwords.

1088
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,915
Rym: if you set it up get this?

1089
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:43,000
Rym: you text some number.

1090
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:46,755
Rym: It texts you back a temporary password that you can log in in the next 20 minutes.

1091
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:57,360
Rym: All right, and That's a great part of the problem is great part of the problem of email You know being the point of attack for everyone is that you can reset all the passwords to email.

1092
01:03:57,843 --> 01:04:02,166
Rym: It's a hell of a lot harder to hack someone's phone Straight up.

1093
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:03,840
Scott: It's really easy to send someone's text.

1094
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,600
Scott: It's really hard to intercept someone's text unless you take their phone.

1095
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:08,813
Scott: Which do you do have to worry about?

1096
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:09,860
Scott: people are very close to you.

1097
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:17,086
Scott: A lot of people are very free about like letting their family members mess with their phone and sharing, you know This is something people really need to do.

1098
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,080
Scott: and you know, I mean a lot of people have you know, trustworthy families.

1099
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,390
Rym: It's a lot of shared passwords in situations where there's no better solution But everyone should have their own.

1100
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:38,960
Scott: the thing is a lot of people Have you know, they get fucked by the people that are closest to them, you know There's plenty of people have like shitty parents or you know shitty, you know spouses or shitty siblings.

1101
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:39,963
Rym: Not just text out.

1102
01:04:39,983 --> 01:04:41,267
Scott: don't share your shit.

1103
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:48,070
Scott: Don't let anyone even touch your phone, you know, even if it's like, you know You're your person you've been married to for 50 years.

1104
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,296
Scott: Do not let them touch your phone.

1105
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:52,620
Scott: get your own damn phone Right because who knows what the fuck right?

1106
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,440
Scott: You can't even if it's it could be incompetence that fucks you over, you know, well, I would argue more generally.

1107
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,758
Rym: I mean, I let people use my phone sometimes because there's not much on my phone.

1108
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:07,121
Scott: You could do No, but I mean like, you know, somebody could get a one-time password with my text messaging, you know It's.

1109
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,066
Scott: that's pretty serious.

1110
01:05:08,106 --> 01:05:10,679
Rym: if you have my phone, you know, but at the same time my bank.

1111
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:12,852
Rym: I can see if they did that.

1112
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:14,320
Rym: I wouldn't let my phone to a stranger.

1113
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:20,280
Scott: No, my bank tells me to verify like you could do it by email or by text or by telephone audio call.

1114
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:26,484
Scott: So it's like you got two out of the three ways to get to my bank account if you got my phone, you know, so Well the real thing.

1115
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,529
Rym: look at society in general.

1116
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:28,412
Rym: forget all the tech stuff.

1117
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:35,440
Rym: most murders and most Violence and most robberies and most kidnappings and most sexual assault are close friends and family.

1118
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,775
Rym: Yeah, it's not like crazy random psycho on the street or like dedicated robber.

1119
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:40,979
Rym: are the rarity.

1120
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:46,393
Rym: Notwithstanding the anecdotal evidence the scotches got robbed by a stranger by not my family.

1121
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,679
Scott: I could have been someone I know was it you?

1122
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:49,662
Rym: Yeah, it was me.

1123
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:50,826
Scott: Where's my TV?

1124
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:55,020
Scott: Why do you think I have two Xboxes, you know, I should just steal your Xbox.

1125
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,454
Scott: I wouldn't have to buy a new one.

1126
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,080
Scott: You have more money.

1127
01:05:57,984 --> 01:05:58,933
Scott: You go buy a new Xbox.

1128
01:05:58,953 --> 01:05:59,599
Scott: I'll just take yours.

Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
