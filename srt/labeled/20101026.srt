1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,835
Rym: It's Tuesday October 26 2010.

2
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:12,380
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,111
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight civilization 5.

4
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,108
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:38,768
Rym: So I discovered in Filling out some government forms today that in fact The people living one floor above me in my building have a different zip code from me And in fact the people living on the ground floor have a different zip code.

6
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:42,443
Rym: yet again There are nine zip codes in my building.

7
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,487
Scott: How many floors are there?

8
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:44,190
Rym: ah?

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,754
Rym: 15.

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,550
Scott: oh so some builders some floors have the same and some have different.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,370
Rym: There's the floor under me as the same zip code as me, but the next thing is there's a brand new zip code.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,974
Scott: I don't it.

13
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,210
Scott: is it a different on the final four digits?

14
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,842
Scott: Or is it actually the first five digits the final four?

15
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:00,609
Rym: well you think it's the first five.

16
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,095
Scott: Yeah, well you know that.

17
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:04,443
Scott: then it's not really a different zip code.

18
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:04,644
Scott: Well.

19
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,330
Rym: It is that is part of the zip code.

20
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,173
Scott: It's a different.

21
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,663
Scott: zip plus four is the reason it's not zip code.

22
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:11,008
Scott: It's zip plus four.

23
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,674
Scott: right well Four is different.

24
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:13,677
Scott: that doesn't mean anything.

25
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:14,340
Scott: It's like okay.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,390
Scott: Yeah, everyone it plus fours are like they change every few houses.

27
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,877
Rym: It's the actually depends on where you live.

28
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:26,213
Scott: like any actual zip code the first five digits is one proposed in many Populated areas.

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:32,395
Rym: the the board the last four they actually don't change nearly as often as you think it's because there's less people City.

30
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,665
Scott: so that makes perfect sense for the final board.

31
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,438
Scott: It's not a different zip code It's a different plus four.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,790
Rym: the plus four is part of the zip code Scott.

33
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:40,715
Scott: No, it's not.

34
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:41,399
Scott: It's that's.

35
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,510
Scott: how can they don't just call it the zip code?

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,213
Scott: It's the zip.

37
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:48,610
Scott: well because the plus four was the plus four is an additional thing that is not part of the zip.

38
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,557
Scott: I know it is.

39
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,009
Rym: the fire was added to this.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,110
Rym: it.

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,194
Rym: You don't know anything about the zip code.

42
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:53,419
Rym: What's it even stand for Scott?

43
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:54,926
Scott: It doesn't stand for anything.

44
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:55,307
Scott: It's zip.

45
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,078
Scott: It's haha.

46
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,618
Rym: Anyway, you got any video game news.

47
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,965
Scott: Oh, you're just rushing right to the news already.

48
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,717
Rym: well because you don't know anything about zip code We can't have this discussion.

49
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:09,476
Scott: What does no session have?

50
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,467
Scott: a zip code is one number per post office.

51
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:21,907
Scott: usually and It's that way they know which post office to go to without having to look at the address And then they only look at the address When you know they're actually at the post office, and then they can know which house to go to.

52
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,370
Rym: actually There's a lot more to it than that, but anyway anyway.

53
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,176
Scott: So let's see video game news.

54
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:28,858
Scott: You know what?

55
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,550
Scott: why don't we talk about the plastic instrument games all right?

56
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:37,194
Rym: I'm amazed that they're still going as strong as they are But they're definitely.

57
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:43,546
Rym: they lost a lot of steam like they don't get nearly as much Pressing plays they did a few years ago, but they're still very popular.

58
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,350
Scott: Yeah, it's it's weird.

59
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,950
Scott: It's like you figure that this would be a fad that would go away.

60
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,997
Scott: I think some of it.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,110
Scott: some of the reason it hasn't gone away Is that there you know I mean it's sort of fun for everyone to do it.

62
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,890
Scott: But if most people get bored with it after a time, but there are some people who are just way into it, right?

63
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,115
Scott: So that's all right.

64
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:07,950
Rym: well much like DDR DDR reached pretty surprising highs back at the peak of DR went way up, and then it went way down.

65
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,304
Scott: But there was still some people who are way into it and will still do DDR forever.

66
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:20,590
Rym: there are now more DDR machines in the Midwest than there are in like California, New York combined anyway, so the plastic instrument games are sort of the same way.

67
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:27,259
Scott: But I think also they're being helped because a. they're a little bit more accessible than DDR You know and the music keeps people.

68
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:34,359
Scott: you know they keep releasing the DLCs that use people engaged and They also people invested in these plastic instruments.

69
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,430
Scott: a lot more people invested in those and events vested in dance pads.

70
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:43,070
Scott: So because they invested in the plastic instruments they want to keep using them And if they just sit there it makes people feel guilty yeah.

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,750
Rym: But at the same time a lot of people Claimed that the main reason the games were popular was because the rock star fantasy which is a big part of the games.

72
00:03:51,272 --> 00:04:02,536
Rym: But I still maintained that the primary reason most people were playing not necessarily the hardcore fans But like the family or like that because even like people at my work like older people just have You know the cyst.

73
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:11,900
Rym: they have one of the games and they play it every now And then like when they have people over as a diversion, and I feel like they play it because It makes listening to music a more active activity.

74
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:18,423
Rym: I don't feel like many people at least in America in Current modern day listen to music as an active activity.

75
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,170
Rym: It's always a passive secondary active.

76
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,415
Scott: Yeah, it used to be that you would get your friend your hippie friends around and you would sit in a van or in your Basement whatever down by the river.

77
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,887
Scott: you'd put a record on and you would sit around listening to the record.

78
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:34,189
Scott: right and that would be An activity that you would do with people you know.

79
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:42,446
Rym: Go further back and the common thing to do was that the neighbors will all come together Sit around the piano someone would play a song and you'd all sing it.

80
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:51,213
Rym: yeah Well, that's singing that's different Yeah, but that was actually a very common activity among these families and people when they were bored and until you know We had records.

81
00:04:51,775 --> 00:05:06,719
Scott: Yeah, but you know listening to music as an activity just listening not playing not Participating not karaoke ing not lip-syncing not writing you know it really is only sort of done in present times in this society.

82
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:19,209
Scott: at least if It's a concert right people don't or they do it as not as a group activity But as a. you constantly have music playing on your computer on your headphones, but then they're doing something else They're not really thinking about it.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,194
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

84
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,927
Scott: listening to the music is not the primary activity in that case.

85
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,849
Rym: now at the same time There's definitely I mean people listen to a lot of music now.

86
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:34,028
Rym: And there are the audio files and the audio files And just people who are really into music who you know do that sort of thing.

87
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:34,209
Rym: still.

88
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:38,550
Rym: I mean I'll occasionally sit down and listen to an album as an activity much like I'd watch a movie.

89
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:54,641
Rym: But I feel like the music games in particular gave someone an excuse to listen like really listen to and be Participatory with in some fashion like olds that led Zeppelin that otherwise they wouldn't listen to or they'd hear a snatch of in the background On the iPod.

90
00:05:54,662 --> 00:06:01,230
Scott: yeah Anyway, so the Rock Band 3 is coming out, and you know I'm sort of done with the plastic instruments.

91
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,418
Scott: I bought Guitar Hero 3 for the Wii.

92
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,783
Scott: yeah, we played it out.

93
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,510
Scott: You know as much as we were gonna play it.

94
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,099
Scott: I only have one plastic guitar.

95
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,629
Scott: didn't waste money on extra one.

96
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,055
Rym: well It amazed me like I knew I would get sick of it like I knew all right This will be fun eventually.

97
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,672
Scott: like it actually lasted quite a while well worth the money That was.

98
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:20,756
Rym: but it lasted far shorter than I expected About a month and a half.

99
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:25,297
Rym: then I was like yeah, and I kind of stopped doing it and then after about three months I was completely done.

100
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:33,009
Scott: I think it lasted about the amount of time I expected you know prepared to say DDR, which I'm actually playing more now than I have recently.

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,812
Scott: well I think Paul.

102
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:45,808
Scott: so part of that problem right was that we had the Wii version which did not constantly add new songs Whereas a DDR there were frequent updates that did not require changing of the equipment.

103
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:46,289
Scott: right.

104
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:49,310
Rym: well That was only because we pirated the game.

105
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,789
Scott: Exactly yeah, I guess we didn't pirate the Rock Band or a Guitar Hero right now And they didn't come out with more Guitar Heroes for the Wii either.

106
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:58,034
Scott: We went ahead.

107
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:04,268
Scott: if we would have started for example with Rock Band 1 on the 360 It would have basically been constantly new.

108
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,516
Scott: The game would just keep getting updated.

109
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:18,050
Scott: if we kept that we had kept playing it every day and actually paying attention all the new Stuff we probably would have remained hooked you know especially because it had four instruments to switch between there's a lot more value To.

110
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:22,669
Scott: you know you can play the guitar then you can play the drum then you could do the singing.

111
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:27,246
Rym: yeah But at the same time the experience was fun at first because it because it was this act.

112
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,551
Rym: you know we're playing on the easier modes.

113
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,620
Rym: I'm active and I'm engaged in the song that I'm also listening to as an activity.

114
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:42,538
Rym: and Then as I played and I started getting to the higher difficulties DDR had the physical aspect the exercise Aspect the full body movement really getting into it.

115
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:55,300
Rym: But plastic instrument games with the exception possibly of the drumming which I actually do kind of enjoy because it's kind of like real drumming Started to ring more and more hollow and just started to feel like I was really wasting my time.

116
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,871
Scott: Yeah, it also was you know far.

117
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,940
Scott: I mean DDR on stupid hard.

118
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:06,894
Scott: You can get pretty hard on DDR where it's still doable But I mean stupid hard and me in like the guitar portions is just.

119
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,560
Scott: it's just beyond anything.

120
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,148
Scott: That's worth my time to bother to master course.

121
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,840
Rym: we neither one of us ever mastered the ultra hard DDR either.

122
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:20,319
Rym: I mean we're like we can do maybe half the nine footers And I don't think any of us can pass more than one or two ten footers.

123
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,524
Scott: Yeah, but you know that's.

124
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:22,609
Scott: you know this is different.

125
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,636
Scott: This is like anything on the hardest mode.

126
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,299
Scott: forget it right?

127
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:35,339
Scott: so Anyway Rock Band 3 is coming out and one thing apparently that Rock Band 3 has is their pro mode and Apparently I was looking at pro mode and in pro mode.

128
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,679
Scott: well It also has a keyboard by the way.

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,150
Scott: But pro mode is actually playing a real guitar.

130
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:47,153
Scott: basically kind of they have a plastic guitar that you can buy That has a button on every single fret and every single string.

131
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:55,167
Scott: so it's number of frets times six Strings is the number of buttons they have on this thing and the buttons are long You know and thin so you can.

132
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,800
Scott: you know you can play guitar kind of you can play plastic guitar.

133
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,206
Scott: And then at the bottom they have six Partial strings.

134
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,831
Scott: right the strings don't go all the way up the neck.

135
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:05,353
Scott: that you're sort of.

136
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:10,109
Scott: only in the strumming area are six Strings that you can pick and whatever.

137
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:16,612
Scott: so it's sort of like it's a guitar But it's not because if you play it without Rock Band doesn't do anything.

138
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,439
Scott: It doesn't make any noise or anything like that.

139
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:33,818
Scott: So I'm like huh, that's actually playing guitar like you could play that thing for just 150 bucks in pro mode and learn a song And then get a real guitar and play the same exact fingerings and hand whatever and you would.

140
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:34,520
Scott: that would be it.

141
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,066
Scott: You're playing the song for reals.

142
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,435
Scott: Yeah, the thing is four hundred and fifty dollars.

143
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:39,800
Scott: You could buy a guitar.

144
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:46,240
Scott: So why would I buy a guitar that only does Rock Band when I could buy a guitar guitar well her the same money.

145
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,546
Rym: I don't think a lot of people.

146
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,860
Rym: I think have this kind of misunderstanding of how much guitars cost.

147
00:09:50,905 --> 00:10:00,854
Scott: Yeah I mean like mo you know Well like if you want to buy a real guitar like the kind that you're gonna play if you're a professional That's gonna be at least a thousand dollars if not multiple thousands.

148
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,543
Rym: you want a guitar that kind of goes But you can e box.

149
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:28,310
Scott: you can buy an electric guitar with six strings and an amp and an amp that will work And in fact usually also with like a bag to carry it in and all kinds of you know all the stuff you need For a complete beginner that will work and serve you well to learn guitar for like a hundred bucks 150 bucks less than that right I think squire this Fender makes one and Gibson makes one and some other.

150
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,356
Scott: you know every guitar company pretty much has one.

151
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:37,680
Scott: That's like the entry-level Beginners electric guitar that comes in a box with an amp and the cable and everything that you need.

152
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,632
Scott: So if they're gonna charge 150 bucks for this thing.

153
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:41,937
Scott: It's like well screw that.

154
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:48,334
Scott: however I Saw on YouTube They are going to sell another pro guitar.

155
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:53,939
Scott: That is an Actual guitar, but it's also a rock band guitar.

156
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,328
Rym: How does the rock band guitar thing work though?

157
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,075
Rym: is it just MIDI and some sort of like?

158
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,420
Scott: I think what do you mean?

159
00:10:59,840 --> 00:10:59,920
Rym: Like.

160
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,139
Rym: I wonder if I could just retrofit a real guitar to work with rock band.

161
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,198
Scott: Yeah, you'd probably need some sort of device to do that yeah, but that's something I could make.

162
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,758
Scott: Possibly you could make that device.

163
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,240
Scott: however They're gonna sell a guitar that basically has the device in it already.

164
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:22,326
Scott: That is also if you just don't plug it into a computer or you know a console is a guitar straight-up Completely normal in every way.

165
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:32,575
Scott: so depending on the price of that guitar I may be interested because suddenly right that that hollow Ringing is gone.

166
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:38,926
Scott: It's like hey I can actually learn to play real songs with this thing But it's also a real guitar.

167
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,631
Scott: that is not a complete waste of money right?

168
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:46,620
Scott: because you buy a plastic instrument like this pro guitar They're trying to sell for 150 bucks, and you get bored of rock band.

169
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,320
Scott: Well, you just wait you got this useless plastic guitar.

170
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,452
Scott: But if I buy a real guitar that also happens to play rock band.

171
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:58,520
Scott: I could buy the rock band game Play it until I'm not bored with it anymore, and then I have a real guitar.

172
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,390
Scott: So even if I never use it to play rock band again.

173
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,133
Scott: It's a guitar.

174
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:03,216
Scott: It's useful.

175
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,220
Scott: It's not a waste of money.

176
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:10,799
Rym: I predict a giant surge in the number of mediocre to guitar players walking into guitar center and playing stairway.

177
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,819
Scott: I Also agree that that will happen, but I mean it also depends right there.

178
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,608
Scott: charging 150 for the fit for the guitar.

179
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,811
Scott: that isn't a real guitar.

180
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,660
Scott: so you know the real ones gonna be more right.

181
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,770
Scott: Maybe not that much more, but if it's only like 200 250 tops I might get it.

182
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,226
Scott: But if it's like 300 fuck that.

183
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,775
Rym: I think it's gonna be pretty low because they know their demographic.

184
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:37,455
Rym: the demographic is definitely Affluent, but the demographic is not wealthy like if it's 250.

185
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,540
Scott: I'd be a little shaky.

186
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,610
Scott: I'd be like maybe I'd have to.

187
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:40,831
Scott: you know.

188
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,545
Scott: the thing is the song list is looking pretty good So I might go for it anyway.

189
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:47,950
Rym: Yeah, but and then it won't for 300. for 300 I just like fuck that you should buy it.

190
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,279
Rym: I'll come over to your place, and we'll play.

191
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,787
Scott: Yeah, well you go buy one.

192
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:51,812
Scott: you had to buy another one.

193
00:12:52,053 --> 00:13:00,842
Scott: I'll take turns single-player I'm paying for it you pay half, and then we definitely get it even if it's 300.

194
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:13,200
Scott: But actually that would be really cool though if we had two of the real ones and played rock band We could do like wicked guitar solo, and then other paired guitar, so obviously no you got to do dueling banjos.

195
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:13,724
Scott: Oh, can we?

196
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,552
Scott: how awesome would that be?

197
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,460
Scott: that'd be the greatest right?

198
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:19,000
Scott: We had to do that if they actually came out if it was the right price.

199
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:19,422
Scott: Yeah,

200
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:33,870
Rym: yeah the thing is I think I posted in the forum But you know I was a trumpet player and then kind of half a piano player for much of my life and I I was 50/50 on going to school for technology or conservatory and At one point in high school.

201
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,279
Scott: Why do they call it a conservatory?

202
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:35,340
Scott: ah?

203
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,910
Scott: Because they do you don't know.

204
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:44,789
Rym: so at one point in high school I didn't have any classes left to take and I was really just waiting to go to college And I already took every AP class.

205
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:55,920
Rym: so I signed up for the orchestra Which was eighth period and I just never showed up to the orchestra and went home every day and the band Instructor never really noticed that I was even on his roster, so he never thought to mark me absent.

206
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,665
Rym: And about a month later.

207
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,354
Rym: He noticed and he told me that either.

208
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,159
Rym: I had to learn the cello or he's gonna flunk me.

209
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:12,599
Rym: And after a week of me attempting to learn the cello He set me aside and said that I have what he likes to call stupid fingers And that he never wants me to touch a stringed instrument for the rest of my life.

210
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,336
Rym: I then had to play the trumpet for the stupid orchestra for the rest of that year, huh?

211
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:22,720
Rym: So I don't know if I can actually play a guitar, and I don't know if anything will ever help me play a guitar.

212
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,094
Scott: Well, I mean I played guitar when I was in fifth grade right, and I actually was.

213
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,157
Scott: you know I've had this.

214
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:28,820
Scott: I could do that.

215
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,034
Scott: Right it's totally within my abilities.

216
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:31,779
Rym: Can you play stairway?

217
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,931
Scott: Hold on That was a nice stairway there, I know right you like that stairway.

218
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,440
Rym: the thing is or that was a phone call about football.

219
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,113
Rym: That's all right.

220
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,860
Scott: No, I mean like you know I was basically when I learned it in fifth grade.

221
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:47,586
Scott: It was like all right.

222
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:52,820
Scott: here is the book how to play guitar And it's like learn the first string learn the second string learn the thirds.

223
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,647
Scott: You know you'd learn one string at a time And then I got his.

224
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:03,378
Scott: you know I was progressing at a steady rate until I went to middle school and stopped To play the clarinet instead, and that was that was it.

225
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,446
Rym: well We'll see how you do.

226
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,603
Rym: I mean not to not to disparage And I watch you

227
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:07,649
Scott: if I do and I want

228
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,149
Rym: you to buy this game and play it and learn the guitar But the harmonica taunts you from a distance

229
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,606
Scott: yeah, but I mean the harmonica did not have harmonica To go with it.

230
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:22,090
Scott: so speaking of video games plus I could always just resell the shit on Amazon if it's no good.

231
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,300
Rym: scribble knots was a pathetic disaster of a game.

232
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:29,240
Scott: I know right that was like this greatest idea, but the fact is the actual execute.

233
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,345
Scott: I you know I bought it.

234
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,511
Scott: I paid real money for it.

235
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:35,027
Scott: the actual game was not So it's not what it.

236
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,240
Rym: I ignored the people who made it.

237
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:51,220
Rym: I ignored everything about it until penny arcade updated and Tycho talked about the new scribble knots game And there's a new one I'm going to quote Tycho of penny arcade super scribble knots features, and I am NOT joking about this.

238
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,347
Rym: Why would I joke about this?

239
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:54,359
Rym: the ability to use?

240
00:15:55,322 --> 00:16:02,576
Rym: adjectives uh-huh a metal cock a Chocolate cock, but I mean okay a female cock.

241
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:06,327
Scott: so wait Can I apply any adjective to any noun?

242
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,111
Scott: they have every combination worked out.

243
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,560
Scott: probably see cuz that's the one thing actually doodle God.

244
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,136
Scott: You ever played doodle God.

245
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:16,732
Scott: now So doodle God is this game where basically you start out with the four?

246
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:20,966
Scott: sounds like something a five-year-old would say it's basically this Little game, it's a time waster.

247
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:27,500
Scott: It's not even a game where you have the four elements earth wind air and oh yeah Yeah, and you combine them to create new elements.

248
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,026
Scott: And you combine them to create new elements.

249
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:32,038
Scott: for you know until you figure out you find all the elements in the game.

250
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,852
Scott: the problem It doodle God is that it's really just a process of elimination.

251
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,709
Scott: right you just try every combination Until you you know and most of the combinations don't work.

252
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:40,969
Scott: is this?

253
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,213
Scott: nope that combination doesn't work.

254
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,210
Scott: the game would be much better if every Combination did something right

255
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:50,247
Rym: even if it did something bad like maybe Combinations that are bad hurt you or something or

256
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:57,594
Scott: maybe even if they just make the same exact thing or combinations of things you already Have like let's say person in fire makes fireman.

257
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:57,996
Scott: You know.

258
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:06,839
Scott: and then person and Magma makes well like water and snake makes a hose and the person hose also makes fireman.

259
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,644
Scott: You know just.

260
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,179
Scott: you don't need to come up with exponentially more combination things.

261
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,079
Rym: I Don't know why but all I can think is I got a snake man faded some beer man.

262
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,054
Scott: So you know the thing with doodle.

263
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:20,920
Scott: God is most combinations?

264
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,044
Scott: Don't do anything right.

265
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,859
Scott: and scribble knots had a pretty large selection of nouns.

266
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,280
Rym: It was pretty impressive, but the nouns were not sufficiently differentiated.

267
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:34,220
Rym: I make Zeus or Thor or Apollo and they all do the same thing.

268
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:43,100
Rym: There were really only a few things that were useful like ladder and According to YouTube there are only two things that were useful the vending machine and the handcuffs.

269
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:49,391
Rym: Uh-huh as you could beat every mission with the vending machine in the handcuffs Alrighty spot a vending machine next to the star like handcuff.

270
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,175
Rym: the star put it in.

271
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,159
Rym: take the vending machine back.

272
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,025
Rym: There was some dumb way.

273
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,817
Rym: There's a video you can watch that'll beat every single level in the game.

274
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:56,520
Scott: That's cool.

275
00:17:57,062 --> 00:18:07,300
Rym: But anyway trouble with the game was that it shouldn't have like it being a puzzle game was okay But I realized the puzzles were boring and all that I cared about was making crazy shit happen.

276
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,850
Rym: Yeah, it should almost have been more of a sandbox.

277
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,051
Scott: Well.

278
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,055
Scott: You could you could use juice.

279
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:12,300
Scott: There was a sandbox room.

280
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,688
Scott: It was just this place you can go.

281
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,894
Scott: I think was on the home screen.

282
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:15,840
Scott: You just do anything.

283
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,594
Scott: There's a home screen.

284
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:25,517
Rym: yep But if they'd flesh the game out more in that regard and less in the puzzle regard and just made Interesting and crazy and wacky stuff the way to do it is multiplayer.

285
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,985
Scott: Yeah But it shouldn't have been online multiplayer Just been local Wi-Fi.

286
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:37,080
Scott: You know you go to this big area with some other people on a double screen and You you're both standing there, and you just do stuff.

287
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:37,986
Rym: But it's kind of like in.

288
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:44,880
Rym: taiko alluded to this and made me realize that When I played old games like quest for glory I remember the moment when I was I was trying to pick the lock.

289
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,912
Rym: I was like pick lock and I tried to pick a lock.

290
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:58,813
Rym: I sat there for a second And I was like hey, and I typed pick nose and it didn't just say I don't understand you it said you definitely insert the lock pick into your nose and Proceed to die of a brain hemorrhage.

291
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,518
Rym: you fuck wit.

292
00:18:59,538 --> 00:18:59,760
Rym: yeah.

293
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,009
Rym: However, if your lock picking skill was high enough.

294
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,153
Rym: It would say congratulations.

295
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,731
Scott: You've successfully picked your nose Yeah, and there were little.

296
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:14,299
Rym: you have unlocked the torrent of snow As opposed to the previous torrent of blood yeah and brain.

297
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:19,732
Rym: But I feel like that was what would have made scribble knots as a raw concept.

298
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:20,334
Rym: great.

299
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:33,340
Rym: the the discovery of interesting things in Scribble knots was very very very wide But very shallow and the way they've implemented adjectives as far as I can tell is not actually any more deep.

300
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,419
Rym: I don't think a metal lion is any different than a wood lion.

301
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:42,860
Rym: No, it sounds like just maybe a wood lion will catch on fire, and maybe any condiment based lion can be eaten.

302
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,159
Scott: Yeah, it sounds like they just had a list of adjectives right like metal or wooden or whatever and they just applied.

303
00:19:48,179 --> 00:20:04,751
Scott: it Looks different you know or maybe it has slightly different properties right anything wood and will set on fire You know and it's not like you actually need a wooden lion as opposed to a metal Helicopter you know to solve the puzzle any differently.

304
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:13,587
Scott: I would try to solve everything with flesh something Yeah, like you know flesh handcuffs or like you know a leaf Because they didn't even.

305
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:20,195
Rym: this is why role-playing games like to even Dungeons & Dragons Especially old D&D when the rules are kind of busted and fiddly and vague.

306
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:21,099
Rym: was that?

307
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,764
Rym: well I guess not.

308
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,672
Rym: fiddly because you do weird stuff But because you had an eye instead of an AI.

309
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:28,500
Rym: the game master would make crazy things happen.

310
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,871
Rym: You know many times people would cast stone to flesh.

311
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,800
Rym: I'm just like a wall.

312
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:36,091
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's just all right.

313
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,920
Rym: the entire wall is made of soft and supple flesh.

314
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:46,079
Scott: Great now what I use my sword to cut a hole in the wall that is now much softer than its former stone self.

315
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:48,563
Scott: Yeah Congratulations.

316
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:52,380
Scott: This wall is actually the edge of the dungeon and you find dirt on the other side.

317
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,582
Rym: Good job But I feel like there is so much potential and scribble knots barely scratched the surface Which is fine.

318
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:06,930
Rym: scratching the surface is fine, but the game is Crap, and I don't know if super scribble knots is going to.

319
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,240
Rym: I don't have any indication that it's going to be any less crap.

320
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:14,067
Scott: It's just another Game in the series of.

321
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:22,850
Scott: we have stuff that looks really good on the surface and it's really good novelty as a demo But isn't actually worth your money or a significant amount of time.

322
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,257
Scott: I feel like Lego universe.

323
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,460
Scott: see Batman.

324
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:27,690
Rym: Here's the thing.

325
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:39,380
Rym: remember that talk We didn't actually go to at PAX years ago that pointed out that if you have a game with a demo It actually sells much less especially small games because people get everything they wanted out of the demo.

326
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,399
Scott: Yeah, that's why this game doesn't have a demo.

327
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:47,105
Rym: However, the scribble knots had a demo in the sense that if you went there You're a hardcore gamer

328
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,834
Scott: as one is a demo and you

329
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:58,620
Rym: went to a convention You could try it out at the con and a lot of people played it at cons and were like, oh my god I'm gonna buy this game and I think the reason it worked was that it was so wide.

330
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:03,532
Rym: Play it long enough to realize how shallow was exactly.

331
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,377
Rym: they typed Zeus and a god appeared.

332
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,227
Rym: They're like, holy shit It's got everything.

333
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:12,971
Rym: and then they realize that Apollo Same God if you you people right?

334
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,300
Scott: It's like, you know, they say here's the thing, right?

335
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,720
Scott: You know, they say you got to hook someone in like the first like 30 seconds of a book, right?

336
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:35,840
Scott: So let's say I write a book and the book has a whole two chapters that are awesome But then the rest of the book is just the word fuck a hundred times and So if you get even if you give someone a demo that one awesome chapter is the demo.

337
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,960
Scott: So they go oh man, and they just they are really feeling they need more.

338
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,108
Scott: So they rush out and buy it and they read chapter 1 again.

339
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:44,340
Scott: I read chapter 2 and then off what?

340
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,194
Rym: All of my period exactly.

341
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,700
Scott: so that's the super secret.

342
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Scott: That's what scribble knots one was was I played it a little bit then I bought it.

343
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,935
Scott: I played it even more and it took about 30 to 45 minutes before I was like.

344
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,160
Scott: Oh So now that super scribble knots is adjectives.

345
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,359
Scott: I'm pretty sure that it would only take me 15 to 20 minutes to exhaust that.

346
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:09,603
Scott: That'd be done.

347
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,671
Scott: However, I haven't played it though.

348
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,778
Scott: So maybe there is something extra there.

349
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,260
Scott: I don't know.

350
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,043
Rym: I don't think so But I don't I would predict.

351
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:21,200
Rym: not I am worryingly curious about his promise to try to install an IUD into a male shark.

352
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:33,980
Rym: Yeah, anyway anyway Things of the day, I'm sure you know, we link to College Humor a lot.

353
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,320
Rym: But they actually spun off a little site called dorkly.

354
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,958
Rym: That's the idea was and they actually they kind of announced this at PAX a while ago.

355
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,167
Rym: X East Yeah, the first PAX East.

356
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:49,739
Rym: Yeah that the idea was, you know College Humor is a lot of video game stuff But a lot of times it was Mortal Kombat was oh my god.

357
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:58,385
Rym: And I'm pretty sure the guy who played you out in the later years in Street Fighter the later years was at the New York Comic-con dressed as Zangief.

358
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,839
Rym: possibly there is no way it was not him if it was in fact not him.

359
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,364
Scott: Dude, Zangief.

360
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:08,140
Rym: There's a guy who looks just like you who is also dressing up as Zangief in New York City.

361
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:12,192
Rym: All righty, but they spun off dorkly with the idea that all right.

362
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:17,088
Rym: Sometimes we want to make the more Gamery joke like the joke.

363
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:26,480
Scott: Yeah, let's make a joke just like all these jokes We've been making but is so nerdy that you know, you'd have to really be a nerd to understand it.

364
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,670
Scott: You know a Street Fighter joke most people can sort of get it a Mario joke.

365
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,156
Scott: a lot of people can get that right.

366
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:45,594
Scott: but if you make a specific joke about like a specific bad guy in Ninja Gaiden 2 Then normal people are not gonna quite understand it if it's an inside joke.

367
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,300
Scott: It has a narrow appeal.

368
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:50,130
Scott: I even have to like Penny Arcade Even at PAX.

369
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:56,220
Rym: I have to explain what fucking Shadowgate is whenever I use that torch slide that I'm so famous for using in every panel.

370
00:24:56,521 --> 00:25:01,475
Rym: Yeah, right, and I don't think many people actually recognize my I'll take you to a good place panel.

371
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,059
Scott: I'll take you to a good place.

372
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:07,920
Rym: So anyway my thing of the day, this is just I love I'll take you to a good place.

373
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:12,440
Rym: This is just one video, but you know, there'll be a link to all the other videos.

374
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,747
Rym: But Yoshi hates Mario and it's Jordan.

375
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:15,088
Rym: well done.

376
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:18,999
Scott: Yeah, so if you ever make a lot of people have been making video games.

377
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,214
Rym: Almost everybody right almost everybody has been making video games.

378
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,200
Rym: I don't believe that is in fact true.

379
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:27,185
Scott: A lot of people.

380
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:29,237
Rym: and the thing is we haven't even made video games.

381
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:33,172
Rym: one problem You made a square that could rotate around its own axis.

382
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,640
Scott: I've made video games before technically speaking.

383
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:44,511
Scott: I mean I made a combat a multi an ad-hoc networking multiplayer combat clone and we got an a in in a Ad-hoc networking class at RIT.

384
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,820
Rym: I made a pong clone.

385
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:49,816
Rym: I made a game where you tell a stick figure to sing and then he sings.

386
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:51,566
Rym: if you tell him do anything else He tries to kill you.

387
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,360
Scott: I've made text adventures.

388
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,814
Scott: I've made games that aren't really that are just sort of broken and don't do anything.

389
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,180
Scott: Yeah, I've met all kinds again.

390
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,827
Scott: Anyway, one problem.

391
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,577
Scott: I always had making games is making the sound effects, right?

392
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,767
Scott: Cuz it's like Yeah, what are you gonna do?

393
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:07,642
Scott: You're gonna get a microphone and go pew pew pew Yeah, exactly.

394
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:12,637
Rym: You usually do do, you know pull a an anime like voices of distant stars do it yourself.

395
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:18,320
Rym: Just go for it Yeah, and if your game's good, you can probably at that point trick someone else to do the sound effect.

396
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,071
Scott: I mean, you know The other thing you do is you get like some sort of chiptune thing.

397
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:29,120
Scott: you get the chip out of a audio chip from a Gameboy or a Commodore 64 or a Nintendo and you know, you just work that or you just emulate that shit.

398
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,228
Rym: Don't actually get the chip.

399
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:30,913
Scott: That's what I mean.

400
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:34,971
Scott: You can emulate it But anyway to make it even easier than that.

401
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:42,977
Scott: This guy has made something called it's at super flash brothers dotnet, but it's called the AS3 SFXR.

402
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:49,260
Scott: right and basically what it is is It's an emulation of one of those chips.

403
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,579
Scott: It can make a square wave a sawtooth a sine wave and a noise.

404
00:26:53,825 --> 00:27:07,724
Scott: You know like, you know noise but In addition to giving you all the necessary settings to fiddle with those waves such as attack time sustain time decay time frequency slide vibrato Everything right.

405
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:16,000
Scott: phaser portamento filter low-pass filter high-pass filter repeats, you know It's got every setting you would need to make any sound that you can.

406
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:35,680
Scott: It's like a basic sin, yes, but on the side here's the great part on the left hand side There are seven buttons and the seven buttons are as follows pick up slash coin laser slash shoot explosion power up hit slash hurt jump and blip slash select.

407
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:38,380
Rym: Let me does it start you with a basic default?

408
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,160
Scott: No, it just know it randomly sort of with it this each one is sort of a limited parameter set, right?

409
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,800
Scott: So it basically says a blip slash select will have this setting between these areas and it randomly sets it between those areas.

410
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,796
Scott: So every time you click it it plays a different blip slash select.

411
00:27:56,877 --> 00:28:00,460
Rym: noise at random, dude I'm gonna blip slash slice you right?

412
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,230
Scott: so if you need a jumping noise for your game just keep pushing the jump button to hear when you like and then tweak it A little bit and then push the export wave button and boom.

413
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,478
Scott: You've got a wave file of that jumping noise.

414
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:11,020
Rym: Not bad.

415
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:19,560
Scott: So if you're making a video game, especially a platformer that has these sort of, you know Or a shooter or any sort of game like, you know, and you want 8-bit old-school noises.

416
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:22,880
Scott: This is gonna give you all the noises you need really quickly.

417
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:32,740
Rym: I still think you're better off going with the Scottish Ava philosophy of helicopter blade helicopter blade helicopter blade Maybe if it was a poorly drawn stick figure game as opposed to a pixel.

418
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,384
Rym: No, I want to see a game that looks like counter-strike, but it's just pew pew pew pew pew Put put put.

419
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,913
Scott: Ah, no, we should make a game that looks.

420
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:46,760
Scott: we should make a game that looks like Atari combat, but sounds like fucking Star Wars in the movie.

421
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,369
Rym: We're not gonna make any of those things.

422
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:57,980
Rym: yeah, so meta Moment the book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks.

423
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,953
Rym: It's about world wars and zombies and all that shit you kids like.

424
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,900
Scott: Yeah, I have an additional meta.

425
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:16,194
Scott: It's probably a day too late on this but basically Malky and you know all these other people who are awesome webcomic writers the dinosaur comics guy And see I love dinosaur comics.

426
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:20,668
Scott: Yeah Matthew Bernardo Dave Malky who's of Wondermark?

427
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,813
Scott: and Ryan North, right?

428
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:29,953
Scott: They made this book called machine of death and It's a collection of stories about people who know how they will die?

429
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:34,954
Scott: because the machine tells them I guess And basically they had a campaign to.

430
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,244
Rym: I just I Imagine the book being.

431
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:42,017
Rym: every person goes to the machine and the machine says you will die by the hands of the machine and then It kills them.

432
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:44,398
Scott: That's not a suicide booth.

433
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:50,960
Scott: So this book came out and the cover price is $18, but the Amazon price is nine dollars.

434
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,025
Scott: No sense.

435
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,515
Scott: and they're having a special thing today.

436
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:55,560
Scott: They pushed really hard.

437
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,562
Scott: They said hey guys, let's make this the number one book on Amazon today October 26 2010.

438
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,605
Scott: And sure enough they did it.

439
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,711
Scott: It's the number one best-selling book in Amazon.

440
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:12,113
Scott: today, October 26 2010, of course Most people listen to our episode a day later because it's a night show so it'll be.

441
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,214
Rym: let's make it like the number eight book Tomorrow.

442
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:18,186
Scott: Yeah, but Regardless I ordered a copy.

443
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:22,740
Scott: I even paid shipping because I couldn't find anything else to get the order over $25.

444
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,807
Rym: I just made an Amazon order.

445
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:28,480
Scott: if you order quickly enough, it'll be added to your previous order already got shipped.

446
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:30,099
Rym: It shipped the same day.

447
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:31,731
Rym: Damn it.

448
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:38,240
Rym: Anyway, actually I made two separate orders because I also pre-ordered a bunch of stuff that I've been meaning to pre-order.

449
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,149
Scott: Yeah, just order a copy of machine of death.

450
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,335
Scott: It's probably gonna be good.

451
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:51,180
Scott: I mean, come on it's got huge awesome talents behind it, you know best webcomic writers out there among them and You know, the cover art is really good.

452
00:30:51,360 --> 00:31:01,291
Rym: Also, we're gonna be at MAGFest as part of the the mag 9 also doing at least one panel on our own called losing Should be fun, which is an old classic slightly updated.

453
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:02,193
Scott: What other we do?

454
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:05,086
Rym: any other conventions Pax East Pax East We will be doing.

455
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,020
Rym: you should get a hopefully two panels.

456
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,278
Scott: You should get a hotel and a ticket today if you think you're gonna go.

457
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,564
Rym: Yeah I hope all the good hotels are already sold out.

458
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,869
Scott: You're already too late, but you can still maybe go.

459
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,363
Scott: kind of I don't know.

460
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:18,949
Scott: I can't really think of anything else.

461
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,432
Rym: That's it.

462
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,380
Rym: We're gonna be a free to be a Pax Prime.

463
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,894
Scott: Yeah, okay Be an anime Boston.

464
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:31,596
Scott: Sure Okay, so Civilization 5 we have played it enough at this point to do a show about it.

465
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:32,460
Rym: a little history.

466
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,820
Rym: So Civ games are some of my favorite games ever.

467
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:44,060
Rym: I probably spent more time playing Civ 2 than I've spent playing any game in my entire life With the possible exception of all counter-strikes combined.

468
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,641
Scott: I mean, I don't know if I can say that but I did basically Civ 1.

469
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,978
Scott: I played it like once or twice on a Mac at summer one.

470
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,264
Rym: I'd never played.

471
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,940
Scott: played on a Mac at summer camp once or twice and there was no instruction book and no one helped me.

472
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,979
Scott: So I don't even know what the hell was going on.

473
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,120
Rym: In fact, someone gave me Civ 2 and I didn't know what it was and I didn't have the instruction book.

474
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:09,209
Scott: I just installed this hack coffee See colonization my friend had for DOS.

475
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,379
Scott: I played it also once or twice didn't know what the hell was going on.

476
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:21,900
Scott: But when Civ 2 came out I went and bought like it on CD-ROM and I had a 486 and I freaking played the hell out of it.

477
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:24,719
Rym: I played Civ 2 every day and I put in my own CD.

478
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,659
Rym: So I would play my own music and I would just sit there playing Civ 2 for life.

479
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,245
Scott: I love the freaking the music.

480
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,212
Scott: I would try to get Leonardo's workshop.

481
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,360
Scott: just who would play the Leonardo's workshop music with the video?

482
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,453
Rym: I tried to get Leonardo's workshop because then you could upgrade all your units immediately.

483
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,580
Rym: I got musket men and I got workers.

484
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:45,980
Scott: I wish they still had that shit because paying money to upgrade guys is not fun.

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,892
Scott: I would get every science I could until I had to get.

486
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,960
Scott: It was so great because you just built a million warriors.

487
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:54,915
Scott: You got as many sciences as you could and then built Leonardo's workshop.

488
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:59,435
Rym: a Leonardo's workshop Oh my and the pyramids granaries in every granary and everything.

489
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:00,640
Scott: They were so powerful.

490
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,686
Rym: They weren't really that powerful.

491
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,389
Rym: I just didn't.

492
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:04,793
Rym: I hated having to build.

493
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,378
Scott: I meant I'm just saying wonders.

494
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,325
Scott: in general We're so much more powerful.

495
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,691
Scott: Oh, yeah today great.

496
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,056
Rym: Well, everyone has to offer.

497
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:11,397
Rym: Peace.

498
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:18,093
Scott: Yeah Hey you want this water and I have a great wall.

499
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:18,760
Scott: You have to offer me.

500
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,256
Scott: I don't have to build the military cuz you get attacked me.

501
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:23,100
Scott: I'll just build settlers.

502
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:23,924
Scott: we get there.

503
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:34,040
Rym: the game just had this beautiful balance between fiddliness and world-building and Abstraction that I would just play forever and it didn't really have multiplayer.

504
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:41,960
Rym: But I would play for like four six hours in a row While on the phone like a conference call with two of my friends who were all at their houses two or three friends.

505
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:47,760
Rym: They'd all be playing their own single-player games and we just be kind of sharing the narrative of our empires as we went along.

506
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:52,271
Scott: Well, I didn't do that But as we'd email save games to each other.

507
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,800
Scott: sieve three came out a long time later.

508
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,656
Scott: I was at RIT already and I bought it as soon as it came out.

509
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:58,340
Scott: I didn't buy it.

510
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,340
Scott: I didn't play it, but I didn't really play it all that much because I don't I just don't think it was as good.

511
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:04,366
Rym: I didn't get it.

512
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,640
Rym: mostly got it and he said it wasn't that good.

513
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,326
Scott: I mean, it was a significant improvement.

514
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:13,446
Scott: interface wise and technology wise, you know ran out of more modern computers And you know work.

515
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,495
Rym: it introduced a lot of interesting new mechanics.

516
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:16,820
Rym: that culture culture.

517
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:29,034
Scott: It was pretty nice and you know A lot of the things that were introduced in Civ 3 were carried on in Civ 4 and 5. but Civ 3 itself I don't I think really is sort of like the black sheep of the Civ series.

518
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,301
Scott: It's like nobody still plays Civ 3.

519
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:37,001
Rym: It was a missing link a progressive game between Civ 2 and Civ 4.

520
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,753
Rym: Yeah, Civ 4 was a masterstroke.

521
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:43,742
Scott: Yeah, Civ 4 was basically Civ 2 Plus.

522
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,447
Scott: this new stuff in Civ 3 play.

523
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:45,810
Scott: It was like.

524
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,014
Scott: it was like everything.

525
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,540
Scott: it was like let's put fucking every.

526
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,409
Scott: It's like you go to the store and you look at the board game shelf and there's that one board game that the box is Twice as big and it's 20,000 pieces.

527
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,000
Rym: It'll say how many pieces it has on the cover like that.

528
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,563
Scott: Yeah, something that's it for Civ 4 has fucking every possible thing Imaginable.

529
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:08,760
Rym: there was a time where I played Civ 4 for my like every train ride I had in both directions every day.

530
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,594
Scott: Yeah, I mean I basically I played some Civ 4.

531
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:12,700
Scott: I got into the game late.

532
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:19,580
Scott: I waited until Steam, you know, I mean it came out a while ago But I didn't buy it until Steam had it for way cheap and a huge bundle.

533
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,980
Rym: Yeah You played a couple of games with us because you wanted to get back into Civ and we all knew Civ 5 was coming.

534
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,900
Scott: So I didn't want to kill too much time.

535
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,040
Scott: And the thing is Civ 4 was pretty much like it was Civ 2 plus Civ 3 plus even more.

536
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:34,500
Scott: That was what it was and it was you know, it was great at what it was.

537
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Scott: But at this point in my life, I like I wasn't feeling that not because it was bad but because Like you basically it had this, you know The fundamental things going on did not fit with what I was looking for in gaming, right?

538
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,934
Scott: It's like you had to build a million units and manage them all.

539
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:59,573
Scott: and because it has everything It's like you got to worry about the religion and you got to worry about You know your money and you got to worry about the taxes and you got to.

540
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:00,596
Scott: and I was just like.

541
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:03,006
Scott: I do not have The time for this I'm trying to.

542
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,080
Scott: I am, you know busy doing all this other stuff in my life.

543
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:07,622
Scott: I don't have time for Civ 4.

544
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:10,986
Rym: I still enjoy it and I still say, you know You want the short version of our review.

545
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:17,271
Rym: Civ 4 will continue to be a relevant game because Civ 5 is Not a replacement.

546
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:18,300
Rym: It is a different game.

547
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,760
Scott: It is definitely a different game and you know, both are good games.

548
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,773
Scott: But I think that Civ 5 has a place in my life that where Civ 4 does not.

549
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:31,097
Rym: Civ 5 is a revolution not to be Confused with civilization revolutions, which is baby Civ.

550
00:36:31,217 --> 00:36:36,996
Scott: Yeah I have Civ Rev on my phone and I had it for the DS but it got stolen.

551
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,120
Rym: It's a little baby game.

552
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,856
Scott: It's a little baby game, but it's great to play like on your phone.

553
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:41,500
Scott: It's not good.

554
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,909
Scott: I don't know why you would get it for the Xbox or the PC.

555
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,696
Rym: Nah, but like I got.

556
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:50,777
Rym: I got a city I got an army unit the army units gonna go capture the barbarian.

557
00:36:50,817 --> 00:37:02,153
Scott: Yeah But I mean actually I think one good thing they took from Civ Rev and put into Civ 5 was the better interface because Civ Rev Definitely had a far superior user interface to any previous Civ.

558
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,236
Rym: Civ 4 was pretty good.

559
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,748
Rym: It was okay But Civ 2 was actually great.

560
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:08,080
Rym: It was just cluttered looking but it was very usable.

561
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:11,340
Scott: Yeah, I think Civ 5 really has it down, right?

562
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,823
Scott: Cuz I mean Civ 5. a lot of people came to it from Civ 4 and like oh This is so.

563
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:16,989
Scott: this is like they're like it's.

564
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,000
Scott: it's only slightly more than Civ Rev.

565
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:22,882
Scott: It's like baby Civ with a little bit of stuff on it, but that's not true I don't think.

566
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:31,820
Scott: Civ 5 actually I think is just as you know, it doesn't have as much stuff But it's just as you know full of a game as any of the non rev Civs.

567
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Scott: The thing is is they've simplified the user interface so much that it's just so much easier.

568
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:42,760
Scott: Well, you know you don't open up the city screen and see like a hundred icons of wheat and can't figure it out.

569
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,760
Scott: It said instead there's a green number that's like plus five food.

570
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:53,988
Rym: This is the kind of fundamental change and there are a bunch of articles saying basically the same thing so you've probably seen them.

571
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:02,340
Rym: but Civ 5 is more like a Good German style board game done with a complexity that a computer allows.

572
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:07,480
Rym: Then it is Civ 4 which was more like a world building simulation game.

573
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:26,278
Rym: Yeah, and while they both serve both purposes the fundamental difference in Civ 5 not that they changed to hexes or any of that it's that every decision you make every little thing you can do like if you zoom in all the way and Micromanage everything every individual decision matters a huge

574
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:26,640
Scott: amount.

575
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:35,664
Rym: Oh, yeah in Civ 4 the really zoomed in stuff did not matter that much unless you were trying to win like crazy Circumstances.

576
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:35,925
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:40,200
Scott: Well, I mean it's not so much the hexes right but it's the one unit per square.

578
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:42,200
Scott: Every unit is really valuable.

579
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,860
Scott: It took you like eight maybe you know, 14 turns to make that guy and every turn is a huge deal.

580
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:51,620
Scott: Right, and now if he dies, oh shit, right?

581
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,945
Scott: You just lost a unit.

582
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:56,000
Rym: or look at buildings instead of for build every goddamn building.

583
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,248
Rym: That's fast as you can.

584
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:57,430
Scott: every.

585
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,021
Scott: every Civ 1 through 4.

586
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:06,100
Scott: It was build every building you can as fast as you can while also somehow Having one city that only builds barracks and cranks out military units.

587
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:09,800
Scott: Yeah, but in Civ 5 you don't need to build every building.

588
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:20,211
Scott: You only need to build the buildings you need because the maintenance cost of that building is gonna bring you down Whereas, you know, you could deal with the maintenance cost in the earlier civs Yeah, but every building now does something that really matters.

589
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:25,149
Rym: like you build a granary plus two food Oh two food, holy shit, and it wasn't.

590
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:31,880
Scott: you know, you look at what some of the buildings did in the previous civs For example aqueduct right you they don't even have aqueduct anymore.

591
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,036
Scott: But it was like you need an aqueduct to grow your city beyond X and then in Civ 4 it was.

592
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:42,792
Scott: it reduces pollution Yeah, but now it's Listen, none of these buildings you need.

593
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,320
Scott: you don't need any of them.

594
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,828
Scott: You can choose to build them if you want to right.

595
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,818
Scott: so it's like do I need happiness?

596
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,924
Scott: Yes I'm minus three happiness.

597
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:53,690
Scott: Well, how can I decrease happiness?

598
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,612
Scott: I can get rid of a city.

599
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:56,678
Scott: I can decrease population.

600
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:57,120
Scott: somehow.

601
00:39:58,202 --> 00:40:00,812
Rym: I think there should be more ways to get and lose happiness.

602
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,225
Rym: the one one or I can Try to reassign.

603
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:08,440
Scott: I can stop growing to maybe, you know before I get unhappy to prevent unhappiness.

604
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,031
Rym: Well, one thing that is pointedly missing from this is argue build a colosseum.

605
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,759
Rym: is unhappiness due to continuing to be at war?

606
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:20,540
Rym: Mmm, there's no penalty from just staying at war with someone for as long as you want to stay at war with them.

607
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:27,479
Rym: Yeah, in fact sometimes being at war makes you guys happier Yeah, but all that aside would like think about the with happiness, too.

608
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:41,644
Rym: They've made it a game where different styles of empires are much more viable Like one really big city with a bunch of satellite cities works because things like the economy and happiness are global Variables of the sieve.

609
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,069
Rym: it's not like this.

610
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,420
Rym: city's happy and this city's unhappy and I got to deal with all that bullshit.

611
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,326
Rym: It's my Empire's ex happy.

612
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,777
Rym: Yep, which made the game a lot more fun.

613
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:57,120
Rym: I will say straight up It makes it so much more easier to manage - it's it also made it less of a boolean thing.

614
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,353
Scott: We're liking simple hover over that happy face.

615
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,600
Scott: This is user interface stuff, right?

616
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,180
Scott: You hover over the happy face with your mouse and it tells you where all of your happiness points are coming from and where?

617
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,520
Scott: You're spending all your happiness points and that one little area.

618
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,060
Rym: It's it forward to that - it's really clear that for did that - but this is so much more clear.

619
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,526
Rym: But it was person was you hover over.

620
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:18,106
Rym: it was like plus five due to X plus two due to Y per city though This is for your whole city.

621
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,572
Scott: This is for your whole sieve.

622
00:41:19,592 --> 00:41:21,460
Scott: You can just see all your happiness in a little square.

623
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:23,408
Scott: It's all see all your whole economy in this little.

624
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:25,859
Rym: it's also no longer a boolean state of like up.

625
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:26,763
Rym: now They're unhappy.

626
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:27,927
Rym: all the bullshit happens.

627
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:31,120
Rym: you're get unhappy which just slows down the growth rate.

628
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:35,119
Rym: Yep, and then you've got angry which is now there's trouble big trouble.

629
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:46,931
Scott: But yeah, I mean that's the one thing right that we've always complained about is with a lot of board games Right is we say oh man, this board game is a pretty good game Maybe but it's got too many fiddly bits.

630
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:54,700
Scott: Twilight struggle the Twilight struggle Twilight struggle I mean Twilight or even if a game is not a good game or it doesn't matter but it has a big setup time.

631
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,400
Scott: We got to set up all these pieces, you know, it takes so long to set it up.

632
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,309
Scott: I don't want to play it or I'll got the game takes.

633
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:04,128
Rym: All right, even Puerto Rico when we set it up They're like, oh, it's already set up.

634
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,300
Rym: We might as well play it four or five more times.

635
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,320
Scott: If five is that it's a German board game that is more complex than any German board game that you can buy on the shelves.

636
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:22,060
Scott: But because they use a computer instead of making you fiddle with pieces It totally works and because the user interfaces are streamlined you can process all that information.

637
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:26,419
Scott: You know, even if you're not You don't have a huge brain now.

638
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:48,047
Rym: Thus a fundamental for me at least like gameplay mechanism design aspect that I've noticed as I've played and I'm sure other people have noticed It too and I think it derives heavily from this kind of board game style design the idea that every decision should matter that you know Even little decisions come out over time and it's not just this kind of momentum thing of you know I build this and build this and build this.

639
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,656
Rym: I have to follow this progression everywhere all this fiddliness.

640
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,279
Rym: I Really?

641
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:01,375
Rym: try to win which is weird because in sieve - I never Tried to win like I'm going to win the game.

642
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:02,360
Rym: Yeah victory conditions.

643
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:08,402
Scott: I played because I just fucking like playing and so for one sieve - there were really only a couple ways to win Right is?

644
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:10,811
Scott: you could win with the UN voting, right?

645
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,160
Scott: You could win with score at the end of the game.

646
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,330
Rym: I don't think could win the game in sieve - you could.

647
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,422
Scott: you could win with the spaceship and you could win by just killing Everybody.

648
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,014
Scott: yeah in sieve 3 they added like a cultural victory sieve 4.

649
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,820
Rym: I had a bunch of victory conditions.

650
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,705
Scott: They're now they still.

651
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,520
Scott: they still have a bunch, you know, they have the cut that you can build.

652
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:29,932
Rym: Here's the big difference.

653
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:35,578
Rym: when I played sieve 4 I would just play to make my awesome Empire and then midway through the game.

654
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:36,240
Rym: I'd get to the mode.

655
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,744
Rym: We're alright, maybe I'll try to win.

656
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,912
Rym: what victory conditions I go for in sieve 5?

657
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:42,617
Rym: against the computer or against humans?

658
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:45,448
Rym: every round I'm thinking how am I going to win?

659
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:47,920
Rym: Oh, yeah, how am I going to win the game in the end?

660
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,542
Scott: Absolutely.

661
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:49,486
Rym: Am I going for culture?

662
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:50,230
Rym: Well, I got to do this.

663
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,475
Rym: What am I going to do to win?

664
00:43:51,555 --> 00:43:56,880
Rym: I my brain Literally shifts into board game mode every second that I'm playing.

665
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:57,423
Rym: I've started.

666
00:43:57,464 --> 00:44:00,000
Scott: I've just started playing the game in the in the hex view.

667
00:44:00,602 --> 00:44:05,120
Rym: I don't because my video card is not up to the challenge.

668
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:05,765
Scott: Well, you can't.

669
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:07,800
Scott: the hex mode is easier on the video card.

670
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,668
Rym: No, the hex mode actually gives me more trouble.

671
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:12,660
Rym: really cuz I'm my last hope they gave me more trouble.

672
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:16,196
Rym: I just installed an Nvidia update that I didn't realize I hadn't installed.

673
00:44:16,216 --> 00:44:17,019
Rym: I have not tried again.

674
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:19,569
Scott: But see I and my computer.

675
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:21,356
Scott: I desktop at home with a new video card.

676
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:26,980
Scott: I can play in either mode No problem, but on my laptop and with the integrated Intel piece of crap, right?

677
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,480
Scott: I play in DirectX 9 mode with the hexes and there's some grant.

678
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,960
Scott: There's some graphical glitches, but it's totally smooth and it doesn't interfere with the game.

679
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:43,360
Rym: See I tried it once with it when I was like one driver behind in Nvidia Which actually does fix some important things for sieve.

680
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:52,744
Rym: If you if you're having any trouble with sit five at all Go get the newest Nvidia drivers like seriously or whatever driver your video card is But specifically with Nvidia.

681
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:56,035
Rym: the most recent Nvidia drivers fix very specific issues.

682
00:44:56,075 --> 00:45:02,019
Scott: that very if you're a gamer If you're a gamer of any kind, you need to upgrade your video card driver all the time.

683
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,125
Scott: Yes However, there's a new one.

684
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:13,700
Rym: There was a time when that wasn't true when I had my creative graphics blaster extreme I Upgraded the driver and that actually caused a serious problem with quake.

685
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:19,080
Scott: Anyway, no, let's talk about some of the things that yeah, I don't like in Civ 5.

686
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,341
Scott: All right.

687
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:24,239
Scott: So one thing I don't like is that the multiplayer first of all technologically has some issues, right?

688
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:26,545
Rym: Players always had issues.

689
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:27,207
Scott: What the fuck?

690
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:28,712
Rym: Why can't it spy?

691
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:29,696
Rym: Listen, I why?

692
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:30,278
Rym: games fine.

693
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:31,787
Scott: They're not using you So they're using steam.

694
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:33,400
Rym: the game spy logo is still there.

695
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,020
Scott: I don't know why the game spy logo is there because it completely uses steam for everything.

696
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,742
Rym: I'll bet under the hood.

697
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,107
Rym: He uses games five bullshit.

698
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:40,872
Scott: It possibly does which is bullshit.

699
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:41,695
Scott: And again, why?

700
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:42,317
Rym: why the fuck?

701
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:43,420
Rym: game spies terrible?

702
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,410
Scott: Yeah, but regardless whether it's game spy or not.

703
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,457
Scott: They're networking just doesn't really work.

704
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,380
Scott: The game is slow.

705
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,672
Scott: Why do they fucking fuck up networking?

706
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,800
Rym: Why do they turn off all the animations by default?

707
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,321
Rym: There's no real.

708
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:58,449
Rym: that's not what's slowing down the network play.

709
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,420
Scott: the network plays slow because your networking code is shitty.

710
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,907
Rym: Why does the game continuously just say I'm gonna restart and Everyone who's ever making a networked game.

711
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:11,076
Scott: You have to make the network code first.

712
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:13,362
Rym: hire an IT guy I don't know.

713
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:17,073
Scott: hire valves guys because Val games always fucking work.

714
00:46:17,114 --> 00:46:19,140
Scott: Yeah, Darwin multi-winning it.

715
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,960
Scott: That was a game that got fucked up by bad networking.

716
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:24,760
Rym: Well also by the fact that they didn't have invert mouse by me.

717
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,740
Scott: Yeah, but I mean there are just so many games, you know, and s2 was having huge networking problems.

718
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,307
Scott: I think they've tweeted recently.

719
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,115
Scott: They finally figured out what I said.

720
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:34,320
Rym: No network problems at all.

721
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,333
Scott: Yeah valve never has networking problems.

722
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:37,320
Scott: counter-strike perfect.

723
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,914
Rym: Here's the amazing thing that really bothers me counter-strike and left for dead.

724
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:44,627
Rym: our real-time FPS is where it really matters.

725
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:45,490
Rym: on the latency.

726
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,617
Scott: This is a turn-based game here.

727
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:59,690
Scott: Yeah, dudes Another thing that bothers me in multiplayer, even when it works simultaneous the simultaneous mode, you know what I found out according to Asking a question on the gaming equivalent of Stack Overflow.

728
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:00,172
Scott: Yes.

729
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:02,399
Scott: It's apparently whoever clicks first goes.

730
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,391
Scott: Yes That's why I always bullshit.

731
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,640
Rym: Well, here's the problem.

732
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:11,950
Rym: Sieve for and before you could turn on or off Simultaneous turn-taking.

733
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:13,440
Rym: I didn't look to see if you can do it.

734
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:14,080
Scott: Here's the problem.

735
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,620
Scott: If you don't have simultaneous turn-taking I basically to wait for all you fuckers to take your turns in sequence.

736
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:24,879
Rym: Not only that but say I went first I will always go before you.

737
00:47:25,724 --> 00:47:27,759
Rym: Yep, that'll matter when we're close to each other.

738
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,953
Scott: Maybe yeah, but the thing is it only matter like let's.

739
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:35,495
Scott: the thing is once the game gets going Let's say I attack you first.

740
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,267
Scott: Okay Well now I'm even though you went first.

741
00:47:38,348 --> 00:47:43,024
Scott: you always have a turn and you know ahead of me in terms of how much stuff You've made in the entire game.

742
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,135
Scott: I'm sort of I have the initiative in the combat.

743
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,640
Scott: So I've you know, I attacked first.

744
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,984
Scott: It's not I'm always.

745
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:52,273
Scott: you're always gonna be reacting because I'm always going before you.

746
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:57,579
Scott: they could do something along lines of power grid Right where the the turn order is shuffled.

747
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,571
Scott: Yeah, everyone takes a turn and then we reshuffle the turn order.

748
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,780
Scott: what I would actually get two turns in a row.

749
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,220
Rym: I would have a hybrid mode where the game would be simultaneous turns all the time unless quote it matters.

750
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:12,467
Rym: Yeah Define situations where it matters like say

751
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:13,128
Scott: if you're

752
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:27,939
Rym: at war and any unit you have is within range of Being able to interact with any unit with the people you're at war with and maybe a whole bunch of other Situations like anywhere around a ruin where there's anyone within range of it all that stuff.

753
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:34,060
Rym: Then you switch into some sort of turn-based mode for movements and movement only.

754
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:36,380
Scott: Here's a here's an interesting question, right?

755
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:43,560
Scott: Let's say theoretically speaking right you are one turn away from completing the utopia project.

756
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,219
Scott: You as soon as you click next turn on that turn I click next turn first.

757
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:53,160
Scott: No, let's say you click next turn and on that next turn you will have won the game with cultural victory.

758
00:48:53,723 --> 00:49:00,152
Scott: Let's say also for instance on the exact same turn Well, I'm one turn away from launching my spaceship on the next turn.

759
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:05,432
Scott: when I click next turn that turn after that My spaceship will have reached Alpha Centauri and I'll have won the game.

760
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:06,516
Rym: Yeah, you know what the answer is.

761
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:07,802
Rym: Fuck you I don't know.

762
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:08,688
Rym: It's gonna be terrible.

763
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:11,443
Rym: It's gonna break and we're not gonna know and some randomly Listen.

764
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:16,020
Scott: guys, you have to make multiplayer the priority here, right?

765
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,643
Scott: You know you have to think of multiplayer first and design the game around Multiplayer.

766
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:24,820
Scott: right because as it stands single-player multiplayer completely different games that I've almost nothing to do with each other.

767
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,849
Scott: Yep, and it's kind of bullshit.

768
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:27,994
Scott: I don't like it.

769
00:49:28,014 --> 00:49:32,549
Rym: Yes me granted That is not why your entire collapsed in our recent multiplayer game.

770
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:39,709
Rym: Well, I mean because a quote my military advisor I think I saw Egypt's only military unit.

771
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,772
Rym: It looked lonely.

772
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:41,875
Scott: That's true.

773
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:51,740
Scott: I did have few units however, I would have Done a lot significantly better right if the simultaneous thing had not happened, right?

774
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,342
Rym: Yes, you would have.

775
00:49:52,442 --> 00:50:01,660
Rym: you would have it would I would still have because because the military you were fighting against my Advisor said the same thing about him is his military was larger than mine.

776
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,576
Scott: But the different the thing was is my military was largely comply.

777
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,600
Scott: I was Egypt.

778
00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:11,840
Scott: I mostly had the horse Archer Egypt guys who are ranged attacking units.

779
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:24,657
Scott: I am I. they were hiding behind some warriors and some spearmen and if I had been able to go first I could have Launched my range attacks doing significant damage to his guys before being rushed.

780
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:25,600
Scott: as it stands.

781
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:30,440
Scott: He rushed me and these units were basically completely useless if they get attacked.

782
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,879
Scott: So he just killed the guys before they had any chance to shoot.

783
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:36,251
Scott: So even you know meaning that it totally mattered.

784
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,900
Scott: and but because of simultaneous turns he clicked first.

785
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,580
Rym: So the option is always cue up move movements before you end your turn for the next turn.

786
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:45,548
Scott: Yeah, but I you know, it was.

787
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:46,432
Rym: I know it's bullshit.

788
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:47,014
Scott: It's bullshit.

789
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:49,069
Rym: It doesn't matter me or Scott Johnson They're gonna win that game.

790
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,000
Scott: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

791
00:50:50,062 --> 00:51:03,440
Rym: Anyway, of course I do like the thing where domination victory and this is so board gamey only the capitals matter Because then you can get into situations where like in the game we're playing Scott's dead and icon and it's me and Scott Johnson.

792
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,267
Rym: I have like two massive empires and then Alex has a pretty good Empire he's conquering the rest of Scott's and consolidating.

793
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:17,809
Rym: if scojo and I go to war the two big like world empires and We end up taking both of each other's capitalism point Alex just wins.

794
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,493
Rym: Yeah, I like that.

795
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:25,170
Rym: that dynamic makes the game interesting Mmm, even though it's not necessarily realistic.

796
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,620
Scott: Oh, no, it's not realistic, but it's a German board game kind of thing, which I like.

797
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:38,415
Rym: Yeah, also Everyone's fears that the game's military would devolve into advanced wars are true But it's not who says devolve.

798
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:39,099
Scott: I think that's it.

799
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Rym: Oh, yes, but it's true in that I've never lost a military conflict with anyone.

800
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,953
Scott: Yeah in any play multi kind of it's kind of sad and single-player.

801
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:53,739
Scott: if you don't turn up the difficulty to give the computer And even if you do their militaries are pitiful like it they'll declare war on me.

802
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:59,080
Scott: I'll have like because I you know They basically the computer declares war on you if you're too weak and you have good stuff that they want.

803
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,396
Scott: So you just huddle like four good units around where they're attacking.

804
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:04,600
Scott: they attack in one spot.

805
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,785
Scott: Maybe you have a great general out there Maybe even have it build a citadel.

806
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:12,060
Scott: you can basically hold off waves and waves of units unless they're significantly better.

807
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:17,233
Rym: Oh, oh, oh unrelatedly remember we were arguing about the benefits of the culture bomb.

808
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,837
Rym: culture bomb Citadel.

809
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:24,992
Rym: Oh I realized that ten seconds ago.

810
00:52:25,012 --> 00:52:25,875
Rym: Oh shit.

811
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:29,098
Scott: Oh, man They know culture bombs are actually the problem.

812
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:29,983
Scott: reason I don't use that.

813
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:34,188
Scott: the problem with the culture bomb right is like I want to use it and if I'm at war someone I'll totally use it.

814
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,020
Scott: but it's like The time that I get a great artist.

815
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:44,080
Scott: I've probably we've already pushed our cultural borders right up next to each other right and there's no empty space.

816
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:52,039
Scott: So a culture bomb will get me some hexes, which is pretty good But it'll only get me hexes from someone I don't necessarily want to go to war with right now.

817
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,080
Rym: Let's go to war anyway, because as I've learned in single-player just declare war on the entire world.

818
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,532
Rym: There's nothing they can fucking do to you.

819
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:01,319
Rym: Yeah As long as you have advanced war skills.

820
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:07,184
Scott: Yeah, if you but you have to also build a military right if you'd build nothing but wonders and buildings You're gonna get crushed.

821
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:09,496
Rym: Yeah, if you're Gandhi, I like how Gandhi's really peaceable.

822
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:17,787
Rym: every game I see him and he's super nice to me and we're really friendly and we cooperate and trade and once he's got a Gigantic city full of wonders.

823
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:31,000
Rym: I conquer it like immediately and it's awesome But I feel bad and he really he rubs it in after you conquer him He's like, well, I hope you're happy having conquered a peaceful civilization with nothing but good intentions for you.

824
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,618
Rym: Yeah, and I feel bad for a minute and then I look at my wonders and you look at your score.

825
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:38,498
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna win this game.

826
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:39,409
Scott: That's that is.

827
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:46,685
Scott: one thing though That I think is a. perhaps the negative in Civ 5 is the military play is actually much better Because you don't have to manage it.

828
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,010
Scott: It's not about who has most units.

829
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:49,456
Scott: It's actually about moving the units.

830
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:56,600
Scott: It's about Rym wins Yeah, but the problem is is that military pretty much dominates everything else or I was going to win.

831
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,351
Rym: I've had two games where this happened.

832
00:53:58,411 --> 00:53:59,760
Rym: I said I'm gonna go for culture victory.

833
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:17,420
Rym: I was going for culture victory like the whole game and I'm near culture victory like five to 20 turns from guaranteed cultural victory and I look and realize that I Can just go conquer like two capitals right now because the game in the game I'm playing right?

834
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,631
Scott: I'm trying out the new Genghis Khan, right?

835
00:54:20,154 --> 00:54:21,400
Scott: He's got awesome mounted units.

836
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:25,434
Scott: So I got all these mounted units and a great general and some musket men marching around.

837
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,220
Scott: just I totally took Arabia.

838
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:30,740
Scott: I took every city they have except for one that's on the other side of Napoleon.

839
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,007
Scott: So then I made peace with them.

840
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,958
Rym: No you make peace with and then you get open.

841
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:35,964
Rym: game Is he march over?

842
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:36,386
Scott: hold on.

843
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:39,020
Scott: Genghis Khan has like 25% bonus of city-state.

844
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,482
Scott: So I can't.

845
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:42,874
Scott: I conquered every nearby city-state and the best thing is I puppeted them all.

846
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,580
Scott: I didn't actually annex anything.

847
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,566
Rym: Puppet everything cuz there's no penalty.

848
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:49,455
Scott: Yeah, who wants to freakin actually bother managing any?

849
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:52,506
Rym: unless you want to do military stuff I just puppet everything.

850
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:55,220
Scott: Yeah, if you want you can add you can switch from puppet to annex.

851
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:01,908
Rym: That's what I'm saying puppet everything and then later only like when you suddenly need to do something specific It's the only time you should ever annex.

852
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:07,874
Scott: Yeah, or I always annex capital Annex, make sure you do when you have a pile of money so you can get a courthouse.

853
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:19,040
Scott: Ah, yep Mad important anyway, but then I go and I check and I'm looking at the advisor menu And it says I'm looking at how strong everyone is and it's like Washington is on the other side of the world.

854
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,608
Scott: I just discovered him with my caravel.

855
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:29,888
Scott: It's like yeah, don't even fuck with Washington Yeah, and then but I look and Napoleon who's pretty much the only person sharing the content with me now Continent with me at this point.

856
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,356
Scott: It's like yeah, Napoleon's weak-ass.

857
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,020
Scott: You should go rape him.

858
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,780
Scott: I'm like Napoleon's Empire is three times the size of mine and I have like these five units.

859
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,079
Scott: They have been upgraded like crazy because they've been killing big destroyed.

860
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:47,780
Rym: It amazes me how a couple of horsemen and some like bowmen used effectively can take out entire empires.

861
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:51,060
Scott: Yeah, it's like they're just so experienced from getting all these upgrades.

862
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:58,980
Scott: I basically have every single upgrade that gives you plus if you have for on open terrain and then I've got plus 25%.

863
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,441
Scott: Mongo, you know plus 25%.

864
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:04,941
Scott: I have like a hundred plus 25% Plus.

865
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:10,200
Scott: they're near a great general plus another 25 and those stack on top of each other is basically like I shoot a guy.

866
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:14,240
Scott: Cuz the the the special unit as you know range attack the Keshiks.

867
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,090
Scott: Yeah, the Keshik is array as shoots arrows at guys from his horses.

868
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:18,736
Scott: Just boom any unit.

869
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:27,574
Scott: just shoot him with hours dead Right, so I'm like I'm gonna as soon as I load this game up I'm just gonna March these six guys over towards Napoleon and I'm gonna take over this.

870
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:29,339
Scott: I tired gigantic continent.

871
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:33,740
Scott: And basically the way the computer fights they'll send all the units after you.

872
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:43,780
Scott: So you have to actually have some extra units to begin with to fight off their army and as soon as you destroy their army Basically, they spit out one unit every few turns and you just go city to city.

873
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:45,320
Scott: You just go city to city puppet.

874
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,318
Rym: But it's only hard to take them if there's two cities within range of each other and they start double bombarding.

875
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:50,680
Scott: you know.

876
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:51,517
Scott: Yeah I hate that.

877
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:52,503
Rym: Usually I'll.

878
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:53,045
Scott: that is.

879
00:56:53,226 --> 00:57:00,633
Scott: another thing that I really love about the game is that you used to have to build a spear man in Every city and then upgrade into a pikeman upgrade until musket upgrade, right?

880
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:08,560
Rym: Sometimes I'm sieve for even in multiplayer I just forget about a couple of you have to have multiple Johnson marches in with cavalry and I'm like, whatever my inventory will take care.

881
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,732
Rym: Oh my pikemen are not gonna take care of that.

882
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:12,139
Scott: I forgot to upgrade that.

883
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,740
Scott: I forgot to have enough guys in that city.

884
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,168
Scott: I forgot to upgrade the guys in that city.

885
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,260
Scott: now you can only have one unit in a city.

886
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,565
Scott: Anyways, you don't have to worry about.

887
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:22,300
Scott: Oh, I didn't have enough right but a city can defend itself.

888
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:24,940
Scott: It's even if you don't have any guys near the city.

889
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:31,120
Scott: It can shoot and do wicked damage and if it has walls or something It's gonna be pretty hard for them to just take your city.

890
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:37,640
Scott: They can't just sneak over with like the weak-ass military unit all in his own and just take your city because you left it empty.

891
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:46,265
Scott: Right, they actually have to attack a city with at least three or four guys to take it from you or to Companion cavalry.

892
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,672
Scott: it takes more than a turn to do it.

893
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:51,300
Scott: They can't just sneak in and snatch an entire city, right?

894
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,040
Scott: That's pretty unrealistic too, right?

895
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:59,220
Scott: Like there's a whole big city here and a tiny group of military guys just walk into the city and now it switches countries also.

896
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,176
Rym: No spies, I can't just go buy an enemy city.

897
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:05,309
Scott: Oh, yeah Oh, that's that glad they took that out right.

898
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:08,200
Scott: that sort of just was sort of annoying and fiddly to have spies.

899
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:20,184
Rym: Yeah You know I think I'll add it back in because one thing I really look forward to and I think this is going to be But this game is going to be the replacement for Civ 4. when Civ 5 I thought you said it wasn't.

900
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:33,948
Rym: When Civ 5 gets its equivalent of the Beyond the Sword expansion because that added Everything to Civ 4 and imagine Civ 5 with all that stuff just crammed into it Oh, yeah, that'd be pretty good.

901
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,260
Rym: other rider weird complaints.

902
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:46,100
Rym: I wish you could do more with city-states like trick them Independent ones into declaring war on people or make them like yeah I wish there's also more ways to gain favor with them.

903
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,585
Rym: Yeah just money or quests.

904
00:58:47,685 --> 00:58:53,540
Scott: you can give them money or you can wait for them to randomly have a quest and Sometimes the quest is a huge pain in the ass, right?

905
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,198
Scott: Like someone on the other side of the world to be like, hey make a road to me and I'm like, no I'm like, you know how far that is?

906
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,650
Scott: You know how much I would have to pay for that fucking road?

907
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:07,312
Scott: Fuck you and tires just like yeah, whatever It's not worth it to get like 25 favor with you.

908
00:59:07,332 --> 00:59:08,797
Scott: That's gonna run out pretty soon.

909
00:59:08,877 --> 00:59:14,040
Scott: Anyway, yeah Just you know, maybe you'll give me a military unit or maybe you'll give me a few turns.

910
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,588
Rym: That's why I think a modern expansion.

911
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:23,280
Scott: when I could just say I get it upon city-states Why why would I make a road to you or kill barbarians for you when I could just conquer you with four military units?

912
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:26,219
Scott: Yeah, like three turns and then you'll give me everything you've got.

913
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:33,482
Rym: You know a lot of times they give you far less culture if you conquer them than if they're a cultural city-state and you Pay them.

914
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:36,132
Scott: I know right but then I had to pay freaking money.

915
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:37,920
Scott: Yeah, it's not worth it.

916
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:46,560
Rym: I also don't like I have to keep paying the money a lot of it all the time If this was a conscious decision on the designers part or just a mistake.

917
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:50,900
Rym: But how come whenever I tell a unit to go anywhere?

918
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:53,673
Rym: That's more than like a direct path.

919
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:54,980
Rym: like I click over a distance.

920
00:59:55,401 --> 01:00:01,440
Rym: They will go way the fuck out of their way to go through enemy territory to go through city-state territory.

921
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:04,170
Rym: They'll embark like ten times on all.

922
01:00:04,552 --> 01:00:06,680
Rym: they take the worst possible paths.

923
01:00:07,082 --> 01:00:08,770
Scott: Yeah, they're not too good with the hex pathing.

924
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:13,840
Scott: the worst is if there's a road near a guy He'll like go out of his way like an extra hex to use the road.

925
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,380
Scott: It's like I have to tell him how to move one hex at a time to get the right way.

926
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:20,440
Rym: You'd think all right, maybe he did that because that's a more optimal path.

927
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,383
Rym: No, it never is.

928
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:21,443
Scott: no.

929
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:23,310
Rym: or worse the city-states.

930
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,280
Rym: There are two paths that are completely equal in cost.

931
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,580
Rym: He'll go through the city-state pissing it off.

932
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:34,895
Scott: I think what they need to do in their algorithm from what I can tell is Basically, it does a shortest path in terms of cost, right?

933
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:40,942
Scott: So it's like, okay It'll cost you three movement points to get here And if you want way and three if you go that way It doesn't.

934
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:45,519
Scott: what he needs to do is it also needs to pick the path that will use the fewest hexes.

935
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:49,855
Scott: Okay, these two paths from A to B are cost three movement points.

936
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:51,020
Scott: this one is two hexes.

937
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,005
Scott: This one is five hexes.

938
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:53,353
Scott: use the two hex one.

939
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:54,459
Scott: Not the five hex one.

940
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:58,193
Rym: That maybe one of them is more defensive and one of his more.

941
01:00:58,213 --> 01:01:00,447
Rym: but then again if you want it if you care You'll go.

942
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:01,279
Rym: do it turn by turn.

943
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:09,045
Rym: Yeah The real trouble is why do they take they should wait city-state occupied territories that aren't allies Slightly negatively.

944
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:12,077
Rym: So my guys don't always wander in you have to build.

945
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:12,940
Scott: Oh, that's true.

946
01:01:13,422 --> 01:01:15,288
Scott: Yeah, I mean like unless you're a reality.

947
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:16,493
Scott: that's one advantage like.

948
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:16,834
Scott: I hate.

949
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:19,509
Scott: it's sort of like one of those things I hate and I like right.

950
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:21,642
Scott: there are games that have annoyances.

951
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:33,304
Scott: there's a lot of games that just have annoyances and there are bonuses you can get in those games that do nothing but remove the Annoyance, they don't actually give you a bonus to winning like in those Final Fantasy 6 wearing the item That doesn't give you a bonus.

952
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:34,468
Rym: It just lets you walk fast.

953
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:36,375
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right?

954
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:37,820
Rym: It's like a bike in Pokemon.

955
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:44,240
Scott: This doesn't actually Give you any power in terms of winning and losing or any victory points or anything like that.

956
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:46,796
Scott: All it does is make the game more convenient to play.

957
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,819
Scott: It's like You should just give that for free to everybody.

958
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:54,800
Scott: Oh the game will be a lot more convenient if you didn't have to click this checkbox every turn.

959
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,283
Scott: Well, we're gonna.

960
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:57,840
Scott: here's a bonus that takes this annoyance away.

961
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:01,900
Scott: It's like it doesn't how everyone has the ability to click the checkbox every turn.

962
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,200
Scott: Everyone's gonna do it to make sure that they win but one guy just doesn't have to remember to click.

963
01:02:07,626 --> 01:02:08,579
Scott: It's bullshit, right?

964
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:16,877
Rym: That you should not be things like that Game at all like the the the stuff not moving military units through city-states without pissing them off.

965
01:02:16,957 --> 01:02:17,900
Rym: I like that mechanic.

966
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:22,680
Scott: Oh, yeah, but Alexander the Great has this thing where it's basically like oh, yeah be him.

967
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:32,280
Scott: So you don't do what you can just set your guys on auto-explore and not have to worry about them trespassing and everybody Yeah, but then everyone else has to manually move all the units.

968
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,206
Scott: that power really is.

969
01:02:33,226 --> 01:02:39,920
Rym: I Also, once I've paid a city-state they stay mine for a long freaking time.

970
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:41,987
Scott: No, there's two different powers.

971
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,110
Scott: They're the same power.

972
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,100
Scott: No, he has a separate power, which is he can't trespass.

973
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,297
Rym: now They're under the same power.

974
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:57,217
Rym: There are two separate effects of you know, plus it's not that the trespassing doesn't happen It's that the problems caused by go back to normal at a rate.

975
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:58,584
Scott: That's faster Oh, I thought.

976
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:00,596
Scott: I thought it was that trust you just didn't no one cared.

977
01:03:00,637 --> 01:03:05,500
Rym: if you dress bad You move towards zero faster from negative and towards zero slower from positive.

978
01:03:06,142 --> 01:03:09,752
Scott: I thought that was what you get if you actually use the the social.

979
01:03:09,892 --> 01:03:15,449
Scott: Oh, man, that's something I like a lot the friggin social Stuff that what you use your culture points to buy.

980
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:19,540
Scott: Yeah, the policies cuz frickin it It's all the other sieve games.

981
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:28,600
Scott: You had to change your governments and your religion and all that stuff and you had to go into Anarchy to do it and that was just so fiddly and bleh, but now the social policies.

982
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:29,302
Scott: It's like.

983
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:30,045
Scott: it's like.

984
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:30,306
Scott: just.

985
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:34,800
Rym: however, I did enjoy the mix-and-match nature of Civ 4.

986
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:40,020
Rym: We're like, I'm this but I'm also this and in Civ 5 is definitely more of a progressive thing.

987
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,849
Rym: It's more like an alternate additional tech tree.

988
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,171
Rym: Yeah.

989
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:43,933
Scott: Well, it's like getting.

990
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:45,739
Scott: it's like building buildings in Puerto Rico.

991
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:47,289
Scott: Yeah It's so board gamey.

992
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:47,772
Scott: I love that.

993
01:03:47,793 --> 01:03:48,779
Rym: I do enjoy it.

994
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,240
Scott: I just I feel like they can expand upon it and it's so much easier to handle and it's so much easier to think about.

995
01:03:54,441 --> 01:04:02,043
Scott: The user interface of the screen it lets you pick is so much more obvious what each one does and why you know, yeah It's good stuff.

996
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:03,971
Rym: We should probably wrap this up it.

997
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:07,966
Scott: I suffice it to say if you're not playing Civ 5 What the fuck the game is awesome.

998
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:08,850
Rym: It is fantastic.

999
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,580
Rym: It's not a Civ 4 replacement, but it is a game for all time.

1000
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:12,665
Rym: I love it.

1001
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,534
Rym: Single-player is a joke.

1002
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:16,902
Rym: Don't think that that will prepare Multiplayer.

1003
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,732
Scott: problem is if you put single-player on hard, right?

1004
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:20,876
Rym: It's not that the AI is good.

1005
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:21,780
Rym: is that the edge cheats?

1006
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:22,584
Scott: Yeah, the AI.

1007
01:04:22,704 --> 01:04:22,865
Scott: just.

1008
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:26,843
Scott: basically though if you put it on the hardest mode they start with like Extra war.

1009
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:31,900
Scott: they start with like three settlers five workers and you know, it's like they just start with a huge head start.

1010
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:34,529
Scott: It's not fair And they don't.

1011
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,860
Scott: the AI is not any better.

1012
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,140
Scott: So if you actually manage to catch up to their head start with your military, you just conquer them just as easily.

1013
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,266
Scott: They're not any smarter at it.

1014
01:04:42,286 --> 01:04:43,996
Scott: They just have more big head start.

1015
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:52,545
Rym: Yep, and I look forward to playing with all of you because multiplayer games in this because everyone's trying to win really hard and because you Can't have the chump.

1016
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:53,451
Rym: Oh, I lost my city.

1017
01:04:53,914 --> 01:05:06,410
Rym: They're actually really fun if you get past these shit that code the simultaneous turn bullshit and The fact that is randomly gonna crash or like move Scott City one tile to the left Even though I don't really know it moved it really.

1018
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,917
Rym: I don't know if that happened or not.

1019
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:10,625
Scott: I swear to god I'm lying to you.

1020
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:11,388
Scott: I don't know.

1021
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:13,014
Scott: Why would I lie about that?

1022
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:22,780
