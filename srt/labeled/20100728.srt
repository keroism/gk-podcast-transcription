1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,715
Rym: It's Wednesday July 28th.

2
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:11,457
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:12,881
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:15,689
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight, a-durrrrrrrrr.

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,073
Scott: We gotta redo that.

6
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,314
Rym: Dur-a-ra.

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,256
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,919
Scott: So, durr, that's durr.

9
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,346
Scott: I guess that's the noise Rym makes most of the time.

10
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:37,590
Rym: See, I realize the reason that is a bad way to introduce this show is that we could be talking about Rosa Versailles.

11
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:39,637
Scott: No, that's durr.

12
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,604
Rym: Well, that's if the P is silent.

13
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,129
Scott: Der is just Rym.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,602
Rym: Well there's der, there's derp to der and there's derp to derp to der.

15
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:47,926
Scott: No, those are all you.

16
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,756
Rym: So we'll get into this.

17
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:56,154
Rym: You know, Otikons this weekend, we have news from the Comic-Con, but taking a cab home last night, right?

18
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:56,675
Scott: Okay.

19
00:00:57,097 --> 00:01:01,149
Rym: And I was talking to the cabbie and he owns his medallion.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,272
Rym: Really?

21
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,658
Rym: He bought it like 20 years ago.

22
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:05,160
Scott: Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,780
Scott: So why, how did, how did you get to the point where he was actually telling you about this?

24
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,988
Rym: I was sitting in the front seat with him and he was like, "Hey, I'll drive you, but my credit card machine's not working.

25
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,597
Rym: I cannot take credit cards.

26
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:20,532
Rym: I will get in serious trouble if you want to pay with a credit card and you

27
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:20,914
Rym: can't.".

28
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:22,901
Rym: And we were like, "Well, we got it.

29
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:23,082
Rym: We got

30
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:23,384
Rym: cash.".

31
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:24,812
Rym: And he was totally cool.

32
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,186
Rym: We were talking about the city and then he's telling, you know, he lives in Queens.

33
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,197
Rym: He's like, "I've lived in Queens for like 40 years.

34
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,363
Rym: It's the best place in the world.

35
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,247
Rym: It's cool everywhere else.

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,734
Rym: Don't ever live anywhere

37
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:32,975
Rym: else.".

38
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,490
Rym: And yeah, apparently 20 years ago for like 50 grand, he got a loan.

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,120
Rym: He bought a yellow cab medallion.

40
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,159
Scott: So it's worth it, I guess.

41
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:40,703
Rym: Yes.

42
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,760
Rym: He said, yeah, he lives comfortably.

43
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,160
Scott: How much money can you make in one day with a cab though?

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,153
Rym: Well, it took him like 20 minutes to drive us home.

45
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,685
Rym: It was like 20 bucks total.

46
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,120
Rym: So about a dollar a minute.

47
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,343
Scott: Dollar a minute.

48
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:57,406
Scott: So that's eight hours of driving, assuming you do eight hours, times 60 minutes.

49
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,290
Scott: So $4,800 a day.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,398
Rym: Not bad.

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,441
Scott: Damn.

52
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,647
Scott: Why the hell am I doing this?

53
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,571
Scott: There's more behind me.

54
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,395
Scott: I don't make $4,800 in a week.

55
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,579
Rym: Because a medallion costs one to $4 million.

56
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:11,442
Scott: Okay.

57
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:15,379
Scott: So if I pay one to $4 million, how long would it take to pay it off?

58
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,012
Rym: Remember interest, because you have to borrow that money.

59
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:19,280
Rym: You don't have one to $4 million.

60
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,102
Scott: Of course.

61
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:20,546
Scott: Of course.

62
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,879
Scott: I had to do some maths.

63
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,039
Scott: Regardless, it's a lot of driving.

64
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,239
Rym: It was pretty cool.

65
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,839
Scott: If he's driving for 40 years, good deal.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Rym: So we realized we haven't done a Monday show and for fuck ever.

67
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,570
Scott: And we're not doing a Monday show right now either.

68
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,340
Scott: It's a Wednesday show.

69
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,100
Rym: We got an epic Monday show coming.

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Scott: We haven't done a Wednesday show and forever.

71
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,660
Scott: So we haven't done a Monday show and fuck ever.

72
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:43,383
Rym: So we're back.

73
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,006
Rym: It's Wednesday.

74
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,313
Rym: And you know what?

75
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,980
Rym: There's actually for once news in the animation industry.

76
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:54,959
Scott: Well, also in the comics and everything else, because everyone saves all their announcements for Comic Con.

77
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Scott: I really, you know, some other people are saying the same thing.

78
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,184
Scott: Why?

79
00:02:58,568 --> 00:02:59,820
Scott: Why do you save your announcement?

80
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,030
Scott: Like, what's the point?

81
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:01,797
Scott: Like, I don't get it.

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,222
Rym: Well, it depends.

83
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:12,140
Rym: Some industries you want to announce when other people are not announcing unless your announcement is big enough to where people will forget about everybody else.

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,940
Scott: I mean, the problem is, right, is Comic Con is mostly movie shit nowadays, right?

85
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,860
Scott: And people are actually saying maybe we should split it into, you know, movie con and Comic Con, you know, because it's getting all over each other.

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,500
Scott: But anyway, regardless, if some guy's announcing like, oh, shit, we're going to make a movie about the superhero, that's going to be all over the news.

87
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:35,935
Scott: And your announcement of my new comic is coming out or, you know, is not going to be heard by anybody is right.

88
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,929
Scott: So you should just announce things.

89
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,535
Scott: as you know, when you have confirmed something like, ah, we have decided we will do this.

90
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,240
Scott: It is a lock.

91
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,824
Scott: We're doing it.

92
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,619
Scott: Announce it right then.

93
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,126
Scott: How about that day?

94
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,339
Scott: The day after the next convenient day?

95
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:55,980
Scott: You know, hold on to it until Comic Con, you know, and then put it out there.

96
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,900
Scott: And now it's lost in this big sea of people going.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,599
Rym: But it could also be a kind of gentleman's agreement in the industry of we'll all announce our stuff at this event where it is traditional to do so.

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,599
Rym: Perhaps people who run conventions like this.

99
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,520
Scott: What is the benefit of choosing Apple in that situation?

100
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:12,818
Rym: Perhaps.

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,659
Rym: Remember, in the real world, unlike in just the prisoner's dilemma, you only really choose Apple when someone is bribing you with several additional apples.

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
Scott: So where are these additional apples?

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,044
Rym: I don't know.

104
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,120
Rym: Maybe the comic industry.

105
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,723
Rym: I mean, I don't know.

106
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:32,254
Rym: I just your dismissal of the practice of the industry, while usually warranted, I can force.

107
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:36,420
Rym: I can see reasons why people might delay announcements or wait or give me a reason.

108
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:37,590
Rym: All right.

109
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,099
Rym: They want it.

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,580
Rym: They know that press will be there paying attention at Comic Con.

111
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:44,117
Rym: If they announce it another time, no one gives a shit.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,697
Rym: No one even notices.

113
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:50,680
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, if it's if it's a news about something that is not a movie.

114
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:51,165
Scott: Right.

115
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,780
Scott: Those press aren't paying attention anyway.

116
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:53,544
Scott: Right.

117
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,740
Rym: But at Comic Con, there is press that cares.

118
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:01,020
Scott: But if it is a comic or anime news, they're not going to pay attention anyway.

119
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:12,560
Scott: The only people that are going to pay attention are things like Anime News Network or Newsarama or any of the kind of news that you're thinking only of the above the radar fans, the below the radar people.

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,859
Rym: They probably barely know that Comic Con exists.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Rym: And then right after Comic Con, there's all this news.

122
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,340
Rym: And they suddenly start like looking at articles and seeing stuff.

123
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,259
Rym: And the rest of the year, they never even look.

124
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,719
Rym: So the news is all at once.

125
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,160
Rym: And then as a result, the nerds find out all at once.

126
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,778
Rym: These people would otherwise never find out.

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,706
Scott: Maybe there's a chance.

128
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:37,120
Scott: there's a chance that the normal under the radar fan could go to the nerdy websites all the reason soon after the comic.

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,419
Rym: It doesn't matter either way.

130
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:43,960
Rym: And you just pick that date because that's a nice date to kind of plan to do all your announcements and it's a nice tradition.

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,499
Rym: And you're not under any pressure because you're in an industry with very long cycles.

132
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,780
Rym: Well, of course, there was actually very important news from the Comic Con.

133
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,859
Rym: I mean, that guy got stabbed to death, I heard in Hall H.

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,679
Scott: Oh, shit.

135
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,078
Scott: Well, Hall H, you know, H stands for hell.

136
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,860
Rym: Hall H is like the worst.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,360
Rym: It's everything that I would hate about going to the Comic Con condensed into one hall.

138
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:13,280
Scott: Thing is, people talk about going to Comic Con and waiting in lines and waiting in lines.

139
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,680
Scott: It's like, dude, I mean, if you don't go to the Hall H, are you really waiting in any lines?

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,330
Scott: Just don't go to see any of that shit with the famous people and you won't have to wait in a line.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,759
Rym: I'm looking at pictures of the Comic Con and it's just like you think that hallway in the middle of Otakon is bad.

142
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,486
Rym: Imagine that times 10.

143
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,239
Rym: It's like you can walk.

144
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,060
Scott: Yeah, I've seen pictures of the dealer's room and you can't really walk very much at all.

145
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,100
Scott: But even so, it's like, OK, you can't really walk that much in the dealer's room, but you can still, you know, cover it.

146
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,240
Scott: You don't have to wait in a line.

147
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,500
Scott: You can.

148
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:49,850
Rym: just Hall H is basically the room where, like, oh, shit, the trailer to the new Twilight movie is going to be shown at 141.

149
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,039
Scott: Yep.

150
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,458
Rym: And then that's it.

151
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,720
Rym: And little things like that.

152
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,979
Rym: And the hardcore crazy fan just bust their way in.

153
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,198
Rym: Never leave.

154
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:03,980
Rym: Unless I can have some sort of bodyguard entourage bubble, I don't think I ever want to enter that hall.

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,060
Scott: Like what could possibly be in Hall H that would be worth in or in any hall that would be worth waiting in that ridiculous.

156
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Rym: I mean, you're basically about free kisses from Patrick Stewart.

157
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:13,956
Scott: Big deal.

158
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,740
Scott: So I mean, like angry video game nerd, he was talking and like he went to see Penn and Teller and he had waited in line for that.

159
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,960
Scott: But I don't think it was Hall H. I think it was some other hall.

160
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,500
Scott: You know, the line wasn't that crazy.

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,299
Rym: It's a much better idea.

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,454
Scott: And he did get in.

163
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,379
Rym: We could have a Dagen H instead.

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,118
Scott: Oh, Dagen H. That's such an excellent H. You know what?

165
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,618
Scott: I think Comic-Con needs its own Dagen H.

166
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:34,860
Rym: As does Otakon.

167
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,335
Rym: Huh?

168
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:35,571
Rym: Yeah.

169
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,260
Scott: I mean, imagine if you're waiting in the Otakon line.

170
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,000
Scott: The line to get your reg badge.

171
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,000
Scott: But that's not the line to get the badge.

172
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,959
Scott: That's because the badge was mailed to you.

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
Scott: Because this is Comic-Con International.

174
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,620
Scott: They mail the badge, right?

175
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,379
Rym: But then you get...

176
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,720
Scott: You have to wait in that line for every panel.

177
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,179
Scott: That's what Comic-Con is.

178
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,580
Scott: You're waiting in the line to get into Otakon.

179
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,259
Scott: You get your badge, but you're doing that multiple times.

180
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,720
Rym: I don't know how people deal with it.

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Rym: But look at these pictures.

182
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,460
Rym: Every single person is smiling, except in one picture I'm looking at.

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,240
Rym: There's this really fat guy who looks really hot and uncomfortable.

184
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,860
Rym: And someone is trying to, like, shove their way around him.

185
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Rym: And he does not look happy.

186
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,239
Scott: All right, well, let's talk about the stabbing.

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,879
Rym: So, basically, here are the details...

188
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,258
Scott: Stabbing.

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,180
Rym: So, the details that are relevant are that, one, the nerd media jumped all over this and lost its shit.

190
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:22,899
Rym: Oh, my God.

191
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,199
Rym: It finally happened.

192
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,520
Rym: You know, violence at a nerd convention.

193
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,540
Rym: Someone got stabbed.

194
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,980
Scott: Yeah, dude, you should check out Akihabara.

195
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:31,000
Scott: They've got you beat.

196
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,639
Rym: So, here's what actually happened.

197
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:43,107
Scott: Ow.

198
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,358
Scott: Dang it.

199
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:44,960
Scott: Ow.

200
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,100
Rym: And it is the tiny details that make this wonderful.

201
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,380
Rym: Like, for example, what panel it was that these two nerds were trying to see and what they were wearing.

202
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Scott: Wasn't it the Resident Evil movie thing?

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,080
Rym: Yes, Resident Evil.

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,340
Scott: We saw the big cardboard setup for that at the movie theater.

205
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:06,720
Scott: It looked pretty terrible.

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,019
Scott: Had a panel.

207
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,337
Scott: All right, so that was in Hall H, right?

208
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,340
Rym: That was in Hall H.

209
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,019
Scott: Why would you wait in that insane line to see that?

210
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:14,759
Scott: What person is this?

211
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,140
Rym: They were already in the panel.

212
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:17,836
Rym: In fact, the panel was almost over.

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,484
Scott: Okay.

214
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,160
Rym: So, near the end of the...

215
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,499
Scott: But, I mean, why would anyone wait?

216
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:22,368
Scott: Why was that in Hall H?

217
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,560
Scott: Why are there that many... Hall H, I assume, holds thousands, right?

218
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,119
Rym: Scott, the room was filled for this.

219
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,280
Scott: So, there were thousands of people there to see the Resident Evil movie something?

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,629
Rym: Scott, remember when we went to see Inception?

221
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,700
Rym: And there was that crazy line to get into the theater.

222
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,115
Rym: We're like, "Crap, we're not going to get a

223
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:42,337
Rym: seat.".

224
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,415
Rym: And then the theater's like, "No, that's the line for

225
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:44,698
Rym: Salt.".

226
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,018
Rym: Walked right in for Inception.

227
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:46,800
Scott: What the hell was Salt?

228
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:47,677
Scott: I don't even know.

229
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,460
Rym: Angelina Jolie's spy movie.

230
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,439
Rym: It actually looks pretty good.

231
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,780
Scott: But, why would you wait in the line for that?

232
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,159
Rym: Your strangely righteous indignation surprises me.

233
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,914
Rym: I mean, I would wait in that line for free gold.

234
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,980
Scott: Are they giving out free gold?

235
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:03,160
Scott: I'm waiting in line.

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,800
Scott: I'll wait in line the whole con for the free gold.

237
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
Rym: Scott, beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.

238
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,358
Rym: And for some people...

239
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,880
Scott: You know what's more beautiful than any Resident Evil movie?

240
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:10,519
Scott: Free gold.

241
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:11,959
Scott: And you know what they don't got?

242
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,500
Rym: Free gold.

243
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,200
Rym: For some people, Resident Evil Afterlife, like that is the movie.

244
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,719
Scott: You know what I was waiting that line for to go into Hall H?

245
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,158
Scott: Zombie Will Eisner.

246
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,760
Scott: Or maybe Zombie Tezuka also.

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,959
Scott: That I would wait in line for.

248
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,860
Scott: That might be dangerous.

249
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,078
Scott: We have brought them back from the dead for you.

250
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:26,960
Scott: Holy crap.

251
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,698
Scott: Yes, you know.

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Rym: So anyway, to get back to the news here, because we actually have a show to review.

253
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:33,515
Scott: Oh, shit.

254
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,580
Rym: So Hall H, Resident Evil Afterlife panel.

255
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:36,918
Rym: Okay.

256
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,218
Rym: It's nearly over.

257
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:46,569
Rym: And a quote, "Altercation breaks out between two people who both are wearing the same limited edition Comic Con 2010 Harry Potter

258
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,333
Rym: t-shirts.".

259
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:50,054
Scott: Okay.

260
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:59,880
Rym: So one of them suggested that his friend, the person next to him, leave his seat because he wasn't into what was being shown.

261
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,479
Rym: So why don't you leave?

262
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Rym: You obviously don't care as much as I care about Resident Evil Afterlife.

263
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,819
Scott: Who cares about Resident Evil Afterlife at all?

264
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,859
Rym: And the guy who was sitting down tried to stab him in the eye with a pen.

265
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,238
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

266
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,603
Scott: So there was a guy sitting next to him and he said, "Why don't you leave if you don't like

267
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:18,827
Scott: this?".

268
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,860
Rym: And something happened.

269
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,679
Rym: I don't have any details as to what happened.

270
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,740
Scott: I thought I heard that there was a guy trying to like, you know, who left and then he was saving a seat for a friend and a guy tried to sit in the same seat.

271
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,580
Scott: And that was what made the stabbing.

272
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,476
Rym: This is the most recent news I could find.

273
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,812
Rym: That the two people knew each other were wearing the same t-shirt, the limited edition Harry Potter Comic Con 2010 t-shirt.

274
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:46,320
Rym: And the best part is he didn't even get him in the eye.

275
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,597
Rym: He missed and just kind of scratched him a little bit.

276
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:55,179
Rym: The stabby was taken to the hospital and quote, "His injuries were non-life

277
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:55,560
Rym: threatening."

278
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,612
Rym: Really?

279
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,100
Scott: And the cool thing is- The worst part is you got to go to the hospital.

280
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Scott: Not, you know, that you're hurt.

281
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:05,740
Scott: You waited all in that whole line for the stupid Comic Con.

282
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:13,440
Scott: You even got into the horrible Hell Hall H and now you have to leave for hours in the hospital waiting at the emergency room before you can come back.

283
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:16,180
Rym: He didn't even get to see the end of the Resident Evil panel.

284
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,059
Rym: But apparently all the- What happened to the stab-er?

285
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,859
Scott: Did he go to jail?

286
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,360
Rym: He was taken away by the police and to jail.

287
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,158
Scott: Oh, wow.

288
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:23,879
Scott: Does he out of jail?

289
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:24,978
Rym: I have no idea.

290
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,560
Scott: That seems like the sort of one night in jail kind of thing.

291
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,300
Scott: Not like a trial, go to court, go to prison kind of thing.

292
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,580
Rym: I don't know if I were the guy who got, you know, stabbed.

293
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,680
Scott: Yeah, but you really you can just press what?

294
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:36,500
Scott: Like an assault charge?

295
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:37,580
Scott: I'm not a lawyer.

296
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:42,280
Rym: No, I'd press like assault and intent to cause grievous injury.

297
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:46,159
Scott: It's not attempted murder because there's no way you could have murdered him with the pen.

298
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,718
Rym: Pen to the eye could probably kill you.

299
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,960
Scott: I don't know if it'd kill you.

300
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:49,534
Scott: You'd lose the eye.

301
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,160
Rym: Uh, far enough back.

302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,339
Rym: Brain, right there.

303
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,100
Scott: Okay, the odds of that are pretty unlikely.

304
00:12:55,461 --> 00:13:05,159
Scott: You know, the most likely scenario in a crowded Hall H is that the ambulance would come and you would lose your eye and you'd have a wicked cool limited edition Harry Potter glass eye for the next Comic Con.

305
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,217
Rym: I think they were selling them at the booth next to Hall H.

306
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,117
Scott: No, they were selling the Resident Evil movie glass eyes.

307
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:21,420
Rym: Once this nerd slap fight got out of control and after the pen came out, everyone else in the room freaking jumped the guy and held him down till the police got there and took him away.

308
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,880
Scott: That's how it's going to go every time.

309
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,880
Rym: Well, remember way back, this was like Otakon 2003.

310
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,060
Rym: That one guy like went nuts and attacked that girl that we knew.

311
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:32,120
Rym: What?

312
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,059
Rym: You don't remember that?

313
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,598
Rym: We were at Otakon.

314
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:40,519
Rym: We were in the back room talking to the staff because we just run like the club summit and we were trying to like join the Otakon staff way back then.

315
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:46,940
Rym: So we're like walking with a bunch of Otakon staff and talking to them about like our plans and let's do, it was either 2003 or 2004.

316
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,020
Rym: I think it was 2003 and we're like, like we're walking and we're like, yes, we've got it.

317
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,420
Rym: We're eating with the Otakon staff.

318
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:54,218
Rym: This is awesome.

319
00:13:54,841 --> 00:14:05,360
Rym: And then we look up and I see like Pete and a bunch of our friends standing around a fight that has broken out and then they proceed to enter this fray and break it up.

320
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,778
Scott: I don't remember the details of this.

321
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:08,140
Rym: Do you remember this at all?

322
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,779
Scott: I remember there was something going on.

323
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,020
Rym: That's all you remember?

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,340
Scott: Like there was one dude who's wicked angry and he was related to somebody we knew maybe.

325
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,079
Rym: I'm just not, I'm leaving out the names for privacy reasons, but I'm surprised you don't remember who was involved.

326
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,420
Scott: I remember there was someone we didn't know who was all angry, who was related to someone we knew.

327
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,036
Rym: We knew who he was.

328
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:27,900
Scott: Okay.

329
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:28,884
Scott: Wow.

330
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,739
Rym: Having some trouble here?

331
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:31,700
Scott: Oh, anyway.

332
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,240
Rym: What did you eat for lunch yesterday?

333
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:34,199
Scott: Yesterday?

334
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,540
Scott: Peanut butter and jelly.

335
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,458
Rym: Four days ago.

336
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:37,260
Scott: Peanut butter.

337
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,711
Scott: Well, four days ago was Sunday.

338
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,760
Rym: I think you've got Alzheimer's.

339
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,879
Scott: I didn't, I didn't eat lunch Sunday.

340
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:42,609
Rym: Uh huh.

341
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:43,616
Scott: All right.

342
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Rym: Regardless, every nerd fight I've ever seen at a con has ended with someone intervening because it's really easy to intervene into nerd slap fights.

343
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,720
Scott: There aren't often fights where there's no intervention.

344
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:59,300
Scott: Well, these public fights, public fights.

345
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,851
Rym: That is the extent of the fullness of the knowledge of the stabbing in Hall H. Okay.

346
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,700
Scott: So his is a bunch of really tiny news that are more anime manga related, right?

347
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,600
Scott: Cause there were a bunch of comic news that were, you know, not manga, but you know what?

348
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,178
Scott: They all sucked.

349
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,640
Scott: So news number one, Eisner award winners, as is always at the comic con, right?

350
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:20,940
Scott: Only really important.

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Scott: Well, I'm sure there are other important winners, but the most important winner, Yoshihiro Tatsumi's, uh, drifting life.

352
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,377
Scott: It won two, two Eisner awards.

353
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:30,979
Scott: What does that mean?

354
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,339
Scott: That means you should read it.

355
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:34,879
Scott: If you haven't read it, you suck.

356
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,837
Scott: Read it now.

357
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,559
Scott: No other manga has won any Eisner awards this year.

358
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
Scott: So Yoshihiro Tatsumi's a drifting life.

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,559
Scott: Go on Amazon, buy it or else you suck.

360
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:45,720
Scott: Two Eisner awards.

361
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,338
Scott: That means read it.

362
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,219
Rym: I think much more important.

363
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,180
Rym: I'm sure you're going to talk about this.

364
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,780
Rym: Some, uh, some important shows are released on DVD are going to be released on DVD.

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:00,080
Scott: Well, you know, the, uh, the galaxy express three, nine movie and also the second movie, which is just as awesome, right?

366
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:06,220
Scott: Have been on VHS and we're on sci-fi channel, but now they're finally going to be on DVD from discotheque media.

367
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,619
Scott: But discotheque is also releasing project ACO.

368
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,256
Rym: Holy crap.

369
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,499
Rym: That was in fact the third anime I ever saw.

370
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,960
Rym: And I think we talked about this like three or four years ago.

371
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,558
Scott: Express movie might've been the third anime I saw that.

372
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,720
Scott: It was that Saturday.

373
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Rym: It was like vampire hunter D, robot carnival, project ACO, galaxy express.

374
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,335
Rym: Earth's answer to.

375
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,780
Scott: They're all old sci-fi channel stuff.

376
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,099
Rym: Kashawn, robot hunter.

377
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:36,900
Scott: Interestingly enough in the very same, um, announcement, they announced that they're going to release sword fighting.

378
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Scott: Very good on DVD in the U S sort of fighting.

379
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,560
Rym: Very good was a mediocre movie with very good sword fighting.

380
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:55,480
Scott: And what I didn't know what it says here is that, uh, the princess blade reimagines a historical manga that is written by Kazuo Kami Mora and also Kazuo.

381
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,996
Scott: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

382
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,460
Scott: I didn't know there was any connection between Kazuo Koike and sword fighting.

383
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,260
Scott: Very good article.

384
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,960
Rym: Doesn't say what that is though.

385
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,000
Scott: What is that manga?

386
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,599
Scott: Oh, historical manga.

387
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,140
Scott: But yeah.

388
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,410
Scott: Yeah.

389
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,015
Rym: What is it?

390
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,455
Rym: Why did they not tell us this?

391
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,539
Rym: I don't know.

392
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,180
Scott: Um, yeah, but yeah, galaxy express movies.

393
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,997
Scott: Like I'm just going to buy them at like full price, whatever on Amazon.

394
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:21,740
Rym: project ACO too.

395
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:35,189
Rym: And I, as a kind of a shout out slash plug, you guys should go find, there's an old anime world order show where they reviewed project ACO and the history as to how and why project ACO was made is hilarious and independently.

396
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:47,220
Rym: project ACO is hilarious and independently, independently, anyone who watches project ACO before they turn like 11 will probably not understand that it is supposed to be a comedy.

397
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,678
Scott: You'll think it's a serious thing.

398
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,519
Rym: I thought it was a straight up like dead serious sci-fi.

399
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,840
Scott: Anyway, also, uh, interesting releases, right?

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Scott: Drawn and quarterly.

401
00:17:55,821 --> 00:18:00,560
Scott: Who's been doing some awesome releases of serious old high quality mangas, right?

402
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,020
Scott: Is releasing two mangas written by the creator of, uh, giga no Kitaro.

403
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,300
Rym: Ah, not the good Kitaro.

404
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,260
Rym: I prefer hakaba.

405
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,119
Rym: Anyway, it's the same guy.

406
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:20,032
Rym: I know, but it's not that gay, gay, gay Kitaro is kind of funny and Kitaro is hilarious or dark, depending on what kind of person is.

407
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,259
Scott: the same guy did both of them.

408
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:26,240
Scott: So this guy, uh, he did two other mangas that are coming out from drawn and quarterly.

409
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,617
Scott: One of them is called onward towards our noble deaths, which is a war manga, which is like, Oh my God.

410
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,660
Rym: That's a good title.

411
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,900
Scott: And the other one is non non ba, which is about a boy in the thirties.

412
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,298
Scott: Who's introduced to the world of, uh, you know, yokai and such, and he's going to see some awesome shit.

413
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:56,180
Scott: So apparently that manga won the award for best comic book at the uncle in 07, which if anyone doesn't know on glam is basically the, uh, comic con of Europe.

414
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:02,018
Scott: So if you that's, you know, if you're in Europe, it's like board games, Essen, comic con on glam.

415
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:07,940
Rym: Actually, randomly, one of my coworkers sent me an article about S and they were like, how come you don't ever go there every year?

416
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Scott: And I was like, it's in fucking Essen.

417
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:12,679
Scott: Maybe we should go.

418
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,240
Scott: You know what?

419
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,660
Scott: Next year, Essen wants it.

420
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,400
Rym: Wait, this is dangerous because that's how we wait.

421
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,899
Scott: Maybe Essen is still this year.

422
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:20,329
Rym: Fuck.

423
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:21,759
Rym: I can't go this year.

424
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,900
Rym: I got too much planned.

425
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,385
Scott: We'll get, we're going to go to.

426
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:33,800
Scott: if, if Essen is this year still, and it hasn't happened yet, we're not going, but the Essen of 2011, watch it's on the same weekend as packs.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,536
Scott: Then we won't go.

428
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,872
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,099
Scott: But if it's just, you know, Essen, we'll go on.

430
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:39,013
Scott: Let's go to Essen.

431
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Rym: So briefly, but you know what?

432
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,739
Scott: If we go to Essen, let's also go and look at German castles and such and such and such.

433
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,179
Rym: If I'm going to Europe, I'm taking at least a week off work.

434
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,639
Scott: Probably two.

435
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,260
Rym: Thing is if it's in the spring, I'm going to Japan in the spring.

436
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,479
Rym: So we'll, we'll see.

437
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,479
Scott: We'll see when the Essen is, but let's, I don't even know.

438
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,099
Scott: I just, that's all right.

439
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:01,939
Rym: A tiny bit, but this is worth discussing later, maybe in the forum, maybe on another show.

440
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:11,640
Rym: But the guy who wrote Cowboy Bebop Daisato Sato said that basically said the anime industry sucks now and it's going to die within a few decades.

441
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:12,598
Rym: Obvious.

442
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,696
Rym: He has a lot of interesting reasons why, and it's mad props to him for having the balls to speak up.

443
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,359
Rym: But I'll point something out.

444
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,599
Scott: Say everything we already know.

445
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,360
Rym: He said, you know, there are anime now that are still fighting these stagnating trends.

446
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,479
Scott: There, there sure are.

447
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,560
Rym: Eden of the East and Ergo Proxy.

448
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,100
Scott: They're all, they're all in no automata.

449
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,980
Rym: And we started watching both of those.

450
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,620
Rym: Didn't finish them.

451
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Scott: I feel like that block get canceled or not.

452
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,520
Rym: I don't know, but I feel like I'm just going to buy Ergo Proxy.

453
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,759
Rym: We got to watch all of it.

454
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,519
Rym: Start from the beginning.

455
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,659
Scott: I'm watching Eden of the East right now.

456
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,720
Scott: I watched the first episode a long time ago, but now I'm rewatching.

457
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,080
Rym: I rewatched episode one yesterday and I guess episode two today, but I'm not going to talk about the rest of the, like the impetus of his article.

458
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,000
Rym: I want to point out one thing that was unpointed out by many people talking about this.

459
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:56,258
Scott: Okay.

460
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,116
Rym: Eden of the East and Ergo Proxy, the two shows that he says, yes, they're fighting the good fight, have something very important in common.

461
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:04,700
Scott: that he wrote them.

462
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,715
Rym: He wrote both of them.

463
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:13,560
Scott: Even so though, he is, he is, uh, you know, he writes, he writes the good animes.

464
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,197
Scott: What can you say?

465
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:25,640
Rym: So things of the day, what do you got for me, Scott?

466
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,559
Scott: Oh, you want to know what I got?

467
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,340
Scott: Even though mine is vastly superior.

468
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,460
Scott: So one of the greatest anime voice actors of all time, maybe not if the greatest.

469
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,119
Rym: Well, it's either pumpkin head or a door.

470
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:40,220
Scott: No idea.

471
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,564
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,179
Scott: So he is awesome.

473
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:54,100
Scott: Uh, and what I did not realize is I don't know if this is a meme or if he's actually doing this, I cannot tell, right?

474
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:54,798
Scott: Either way.

475
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:55,760
Scott: It's a thing of the day.

476
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:56,359
Scott: That is awesome.

477
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,500
Scott: What do you, what we got here is there are multiple videos on YouTube that are Norio Wakamoto doing the opener to some anime.

478
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,159
Scott: So here's Norio.

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,118
Scott: Wakamoto sings, Evangeline opener.

480
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,700
Scott: Well, Rio for good channel opener.

481
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,877
Scott: So, but the one that is my thing of the day is Norio.

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,240
Scott: Wakamoto sings lucky star opener.

483
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,898
Scott: That is my thing of the day.

484
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,080
Scott: Oh, snap.

485
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,399
Scott: You got to see this shit and well hear this shit.

486
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:32,098
Scott: Also this actually some legitimate, uh, documentaries, at least, uh, interviews with Norio Wakamoto on YouTube that you should totally check out and, uh, plenty of other scenes, uh, where you can hear him.

487
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:42,060
Scott: Doing awesome things like, you know, speaking in English as, uh, as the, the Catholic in Hellsing or being Chiyo's dad or whatever else he's doing.

488
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,740
Rym: So that is pretty awesome.

489
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,560
Scott: It's all about Norio Wakamoto today in Scott's thing of the day.

490
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:51,639
Rym: I have for you a list of the 10 most famous penises in the land.

491
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,360
Scott: It's got Ruben.

492
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,240
Rym: Maybe Juan Batista dos Santos.

493
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,020
Scott: That was me in a past life.

494
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:00,938
Rym: You know what his deal was?

495
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:01,776
Scott: It was so big.

496
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,474
Rym: No, no.

497
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,600
Scott: You wrapped around the world.

498
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:05,960
Scott: That's why everyone knew it was so famous.

499
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,497
Rym: Daddy to PP.

500
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,180
Rym: Both functional.

501
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:11,099
Scott: For serious.

502
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,780
Rym: For serious.

503
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,859
Scott: Did the P come out both?

504
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,219
Rym: Uh, actually it talks about that.

505
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,840
Rym: Here's a real picture of the double penis.

506
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,512
Scott: Was it actually two penises or they were separate?

507
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:20,939
Scott: or was it they had, he had?

508
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,840
Scott: just, they were separate or is just the hose had a Y splitter.

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,698
Rym: Now they were separate.

510
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:25,460
Scott: Really?

511
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,200
Scott: So he could actually, maybe he had to pee on the right and then maybe later.

512
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,340
Rym: actually the story as to who he ended up having a relationship with is quite amazing.

513
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,859
Scott: Oh wow.

514
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:45,079
Rym: He could probably, he could do the shocker, but, but that's, there's the, uh, the half millimeter penis that caused a children's book from Germany to be banned in America.

515
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,759
Scott: Rym was, Rym was the model for that.

516
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:47,698
Rym: Dirk Diggler.

517
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:49,300
Rym: And it goes on from there.

518
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,619
Rym: It's an interesting list.

519
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,598
Rym: The only, there's one disturbing one toward the end too.

520
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:01,640
Rym: If you count John Wayne Bobbitt and Rasputin's penis is either very large or that is actually some sort of root vegetable.

521
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,180
Scott: I doubt that that is actually Rasputin's penis.

522
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,959
Rym: If it is, they ripped out a sizable portion of that man.

523
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:14,756
Scott: Well, you know, if you, depending on which tail you believe, I mean, they would have had access to the entire body.

524
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,600
Rym: So, so the meta moment I suppose is in order.

525
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,820
Rym: Otakon is this weekend.

526
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,978
Scott: We won't be there.

527
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,753
Rym: This is the first time in almost a decade that we have not been to eight Otakons in a row.

528
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,020
Scott: This would have been number nine.

529
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,558
Rym: You almost said Otakon.

530
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,333
Scott: Otakon.

531
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,258
Rym: You said Ana.

532
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,140
Rym: No, I get to this day.

533
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,440
Rym: It amazes me when someone will say Otakon.

534
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,940
Scott: Well, it doesn't mean there's that guy in metal gear, right?

535
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Scott: And they always get confused.

536
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:42,450
Scott: But it's Adam.

537
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,117
Rym: It's our friend Adam who does it.

538
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:49,077
Scott: He's been to Otakon for- It's Otakon and it's for Otaku, right?

539
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,879
Scott: It is a kon of Otaku.

540
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,299
Scott: So it's Otakon.

541
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,058
Rym: It's for American Otaku.

542
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,020
Rym: Yes, but you know- We have a slightly different definition of the word.

543
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,580
Scott: It's Otaku Otakon.

544
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,371
Rym: Yeah, but Otakon is this weekend, the 31st and 1st.

545
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:08,059
Rym: You know, we're not doing any panels at it and we'll see what we do next year.

546
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,120
Rym: But one thing I will note for those of you who are going.

547
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:12,660
Rym: They don't mail the badges.

548
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,320
Rym: The line on Thursday is very long.

549
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,479
Scott: The line on Friday is worse.

550
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:23,640
Rym: Yes, there is going to be likely a severe thunderstorm in Baltimore Thursday while everyone's going to be in line trying to get their badges.

551
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,359
Scott: Bring your umbrella.

552
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:28,158
Rym: If there is a thunderstorm, I suggest to you.

553
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,940
Rym: But I also suggest not to listen to me because I'm not liable if you get struck by lightning.

554
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,820
Rym: Do not get out of that line because the Friday line will be a disaster.

555
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,679
Rym: It always is.

556
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,460
Scott: Yeah, it is rain Thursday.

557
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,578
Scott: No matter what.

558
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,320
Scott: If there's rain on Thursday, a lot of people will probably leave the Thursday line.

559
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,420
Scott: This is just, you know, logic, right?

560
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:49,160
Scott: And they'll go to the Friday line where there won't be rain.

561
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,359
Scott: You do not want to do this.

562
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,319
Scott: The Thursday line, you will succeed in getting your badge.

563
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,420
Scott: But the Friday line, the Friday line is multi hours already.

564
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,936
Rym: Now, imagine if half the people on Thursday and they get like 10 to 14,000 people on Thursday.

565
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:05,998
Rym: If even a quarter of them get in the Friday line.

566
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:17,020
Scott: And also a recommendation, you know, shortly towards the middle of the day on Friday, what's going to happen is the lines will pretty much be gone.

567
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:17,620
Scott: Right.

568
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:21,579
Scott: And, you know, the whole registration area sort of opens up and you can walk through there easily.

569
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:27,419
Scott: As soon as that happens, go get your 18 plus wristband for violent movies, because otherwise you're gonna have to wait.

570
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,814
Scott: If you wait until right before the violent movies, you're probably going to miss some of them waiting in that stupid line to get your wristbands.

571
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,196
Scott: to get your wristband early in the day.

572
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:34,778
Rym: Yep.

573
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:35,999
Rym: Oh, God.

574
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,680
Rym: We don't have as much other advice we should really give.

575
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,319
Scott: There's going to be a lot of actually there's going to be a lot of awesome stuff at Otakon.

576
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,175
Scott: That's not us.

577
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
Scott: None of it's going to be us.

578
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,158
Scott: So you should check it all out.

579
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:46,595
Scott: Yep.

580
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
Scott: Like Yoshida Brothers.

581
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,676
Scott: Check that out.

582
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,558
Scott: Artist Allie.

583
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,357
Scott: Check that out.

584
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,980
Scott: Violent movies late at night.

585
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,637
Scott: Check that out.

586
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:52,848
Rym: Yep.

587
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,339
Rym: But I will say if you have any feedback about Otakon that you want them to know, like say you wanted them to mail the badges or you want to know why we weren't there or you wanted Daryl Surratt to have panels or you wanted Super Art Fight to do their awesome show.

588
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:12,980
Rym: instead of Iron Artist's somewhat lame show, you should go to the con feedback because that is like the only time where Otakon really gets feedback.

589
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,520
Scott: And even if you don't want to give feedback at the at the Otakon feedback session, they also show the winners of the AMV contest.

590
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,460
Scott: So don't waste your time at the real AMV contest.

591
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,459
Scott: Yeah, forget that thing.

592
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,060
Scott: Go see the winners at the closing ceremonies and also they will announce the dates of the next Otakon.

593
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,639
Rym: So you can then get the hotel early and ruin it for everybody else like we always do.

594
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:31,077
Scott: Yes.

595
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,640
Scott: And they will also announce, I think, the attendance figures usually.

596
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:35,238
Rym: Yep.

597
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,120
Scott: And they'll show probably the opening and closing animations for the con again.

598
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:39,393
Scott: Oh, wow.

599
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,328
Scott: We're not going to get to see him because they always they keep them under lock and key.

600
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,980
Rym: I know I've been I've been trying to find a bootleg copy of any of them.

601
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,680
Scott: And I think it is not going to be this way.

602
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,439
Scott: We've seen them all the first two, but we're not going to see this one.

603
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,739
Rym: Well, from the staff forum, I know a lot about the animation this year.

604
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,500
Rym: Yeah, but it's pretty high quality.

605
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:56,138
Scott: Probably.

606
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,900
Scott: But we're not going to see it because they don't show it anywhere else.

607
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Scott: That's fine.

608
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,080
Rym: I'm pushing to get New York Comic-Con to start having its own animation.

609
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,419
Scott: Dude, you just got to put your freaking opening animation on YouTube because it's a great advertisement for your Japanese.

610
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,619
Rym: People are stupid about that sort of thing.

611
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,360
Scott: So you just smack them upside the head.

612
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:11,320
Scott: You say, oh, yeah.

613
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,160
Scott: Oh, well, you know, you don't let us show on YouTube.

614
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,238
Scott: We're just not going to show it at all.

615
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,940
Scott: Why did we put all that hard work into it?

616
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,200
Scott: Well, you know, we can't show it on YouTube.

617
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:17,978
Scott: So what the hell is the point?

618
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:19,720
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:19,884
Scott: No.

620
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:20,397
Scott: Okay.

621
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:20,695
Scott: Okay.

622
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:21,380
Scott: You can find on YouTube.

623
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,034
Scott: Oh, thank you.

624
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,037
Scott: That's a Japanese one.

625
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:23,518
Rym: All right.

626
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:25,000
Rym: The book club is done.

627
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,598
Rym: So, you know, the next book club book is the way we have.

628
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:31,999
Rym: This is a new announcement is going to be a Ray Bradbury collection of short stories.

629
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:32,856
Scott: Okay.

630
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,400
Rym: We'll do a show on it later, but you should read some Ray Bradbury.

631
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:37,160
Scott: Okay.

632
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,178
Scott: Which, which book though?

633
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,056
Scott: Should I even really say people are just going to go start buying random ones and they're going to get the wrong one.

634
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,159
Rym: And then red apples of the sun or golden apples of the sun.

635
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:47,560
Scott: You don't know how to remember.

636
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,474
Scott: That's why you fail.

637
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:51,018
Scott: I've never heard of it.

638
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,359
Scott: So I've heard of Ray Bradbury, but I've never heard of either.

639
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
Rym: Have you read any of Ray Bradbury stuff?

640
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,545
Scott: Fahrenheit 451.

641
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:57,400
Rym: Any of his short stories?

642
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,491
Rym: Fahrenheit 451 is pretty short.

643
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,079
Rym: He tends to write like four to five page short stories.

644
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:03,920
Scott: Oh no.

645
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Rym: Most of the ones are like, here's the concept.

646
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:07,554
Rym: Let's go.

647
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,660
Scott: Maybe you should turn some of them into RPGs.

648
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,540
Rym: Like one of them in this is let's go back in time and kill a fucking dinosaur.

649
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:16,178
Rym: It's pretty good.

650
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,457
Scott: Also the New York Comic-Con New York anime festival, October 8th, 9th, and 10th.

651
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,218
Rym: Right.

652
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,547
Scott: Yep.

653
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,680
Rym: And we will be there in force doing crazy shit.

654
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:29,498
Rym: Also that weekend nerd NYC board game night, Friday, October 8th.

655
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,360
Rym: Also that weekend, 8th, 9th, and 10th, 10, 10, 10, the burning wheel convention in Astoria.

656
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:38,200
Rym: Also in New York city, labor day weekend packs.

657
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,480
Rym: We are doing big shit at packs.

658
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,059
Rym: We cannot announce it yet.

659
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:44,860
Rym: We've been, there've been a lot of hints.

660
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,879
Scott: We've been talking about the packs.

661
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,460
Scott: It is going to be boom explode.

662
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,540
Scott: Cause there'll be so much awesomeness contained in the small area.

663
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,420
Scott: And that's not even.

664
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:52,956
Scott: And you know what?

665
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,540
Scott: Next year PAX East is, I mean, this is cruise missile.

666
00:29:56,103 --> 00:30:01,078
Scott: We're talking about here, but next year PAX East is going to have to bring the nuke in order to, to, to step up the game.

667
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:05,734
Scott: It's basically, it's basically like a one upsmanship between the East and the West every year.

668
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:09,000
Scott: The one is going to be better than the other was in the previous year.

669
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,460
Scott: So the most recent packs will always be the best packs.

670
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:12,919
Rym: Maybe that's their plan.

671
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,020
Rym: So every year Tycho can say at every con, this is truly the real packs.

672
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,058
Scott: That is correct.

673
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,498
Scott: Except the East is the real packs.

674
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:22,138
Rym: Yeah.

675
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,275
Rym: Um, but no, we live in the East.

676
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Rym: We're doing egregiously unrealized potential.

677
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,100
Rym: We're also doing our home or hardcore panel game mechanics and mechanism design.

678
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:32,476
Scott: All right.

679
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:33,380
Scott: Are you ready?

680
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,260
Scott: Are you ready for something?

681
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:37,560
Scott: I got one more new announcement and we're done with the meta moment.

682
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,558
Rym: Is this something I know about?

683
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,380
Scott: Maybe.

684
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:39,819
Scott: Okay.

685
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:49,311
Scott: One week after PAX West in New York city is recess on Saturday all day in a, what is it?

686
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:51,719
Scott: Manhattan something, something they call the same place.

687
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,616
Scott: The same place.

688
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Scott: There's going to be a full day of board and role playing games courtesy of nerd NYC.

689
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,279
Rym: Uh, I'll probably, I might run an RPG.

690
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,414
Scott: I'm debating what to do in the board game by popular request.

691
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,679
Scott: We have to sign up for it with everyone else.

692
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,778
Rym: I will sign up for it.

693
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:09,498
Scott: It'll be full.

694
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:11,979
Rym: I mean, if I run a game, I can sign up before everyone else.

695
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:17,780
Scott: So in the other time slot, I think you sign up for your own game before everyone else.

696
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:24,280
Rym: I don't think you sign up that one of the perks of running a game is you can sign up for another game before everyone else gets a crack at it.

697
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,672
Scott: Oh shit.

698
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,799
Rym: You didn't remember that or you didn't do that last time.

699
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,417
Scott: I didn't know that.

700
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:28,440
Scott: Ah, I don't think that.

701
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,459
Scott: I think that may be a new rule.

702
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:29,840
Scott: Anyway.

703
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,538
Rym: I remember that being the rule last time.

704
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:32,198
Scott: Oh, we'll see.

705
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,100
Scott: I don't know if that's a rule or not, but anyway, that is the end of the meta moment.

706
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,160
Rym: So there, we often don't talk about newer anime.

707
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,720
Rym: I mean, right now I'm watching Hokuto no Ken and watching all of Leiji Matsumoto's works.

708
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
Scott: Uh, I've finished watching space symphony Mitel.

709
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:51,900
Scott: So now I'm watching Eden of the East and I'm trying to get gun frontier.

710
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,080
Rym: Well, I'm going to get on DVD and I'm going to get ergo proxy.

711
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,060
Rym: We can burn through that and do a show on it, but a new anime that's worth talking about.

712
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:04,140
Rym: And many of you are watching it now before we review it, we're not going to spoil anything.

713
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Scott: We already did a preview of it, but we didn't really.

714
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,200
Scott: It was basically, we talked about one episode.

715
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,597
Scott: Now we've seen, we've seen the whole show, both of us.

716
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:12,419
Scott: So now we can do a real show on it.

717
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,780
Rym: And what I'll say is that you shouldn't even need to listen to this.

718
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:17,659
Rym: You should be watching Dora.

719
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,700
Scott: It is if you haven't watched it already, in which case you should have watched that.

720
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,920
Rym: It is a timeless anime forever because it is too soon.

721
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,079
Rym: I am too close to it.

722
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,539
Rym: We can't put it in anime.

723
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,619
Scott: You should say, I don't think it's, I don't think it's that good.

724
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,060
Rym: No, but we can't put it in anime.

725
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,720
Rym: You should see or anything just because it's too new, but you should watch it.

726
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,720
Rym: Jesus Christ.

727
00:32:37,903 --> 00:32:38,698
Rym: Should you watch it?

728
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,439
Rym: Especially if you're one of those people.

729
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:42,060
Rym: And this happens to a lot of anime.

730
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,960
Scott: If you're tired of moe shows and you're tired of shounen fighting shows.

731
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:56,780
Rym: Very specifically, if you watched a lot of anime in the past and you've started to fizzle out as an anime fan, for whatever reason, this show will basically kick you in the nuts right back into anime.

732
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:57,319
Scott: Oh yeah.

733
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,679
Scott: This is, this is the good kind of show that we're always looking for.

734
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,340
Rym: So Dora is by the same guy, or at least directed by the same guy who did Bakano.

735
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:07,280
Rym: And there are very similar shows.

736
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,200
Rym: In fact, there's a cameo for Bakano in Dora.

737
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:10,409
Rym: Yeah.

738
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,540
Scott: There's a couple, there's a couple of references to Bakano in Dora.

739
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:20,875
Scott: But the thing is Dora, Dora, I think it's Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, right.

740
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:26,360
Scott: And it's not, it's just annoying.

741
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,340
Scott: And you're just making yourself sound retarded.

742
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,759
Scott: Anyway, the reason it's called Dora, Dora, Dora is because that's, it's an onomatopoeia for, you know, a motorcycle.

743
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:40,220
Scott: And there is a very important character riding motorcycle all around town.

744
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:47,274
Scott: So it's like, dude, you know, uh, it's based on some visual novels as many animes and mangas are.

745
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:56,840
Rym: And unlike the usual situation, when something is based on a visual novel or an anime, the anime is moving slow enough to where there's no filler.

746
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:00,000
Scott: There, it's not like they, well, it's not a matter of moving slowly.

747
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:00,280
Scott: Right.

748
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,699
Scott: I think the visual, from what I understand, I could be wrong, is that the visual novels are all done.

749
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,277
Scott: And there's so many of them that I think maybe five or six ish.

750
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:11,100
Scott: And the anime basically covers the material of the first two.

751
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,980
Scott: So you have half of the half of the season, like the first 12 or 13 episodes, basically cover volume one and the rest of the show covers volume two.

752
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:22,059
Scott: And then you don't get volume three, four or five and so on.

753
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:23,280
Scott: They're not animated.

754
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:24,058
Scott: So that's that.

755
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,560
Rym: Of course, I get the impression that this was very popular, so we'll see what happens.

756
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,060
Scott: Hopefully, hopefully they will just continue to turn the visual novels into anime because I can't read the visual.

757
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,418
Rym: Tell there's no AV.

758
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,438
Scott: At the very least, maybe I've, you know, quite a few visual novels have been brought out in the U.S.

759
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:41,078
Scott: Translated.

760
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:53,100
Scott: Not that many, but you while I would read this one, if they if they try, I haven't bought any of them yet, but if they translated this one, I would buy it if they actually came out with all the volumes, just because I want to know what happens.

761
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:01,520
Rym: So I look forward also to what things in the future, because Takahiro Omori, the guy who directed Bakano and he's definitely he's going to do another show.

762
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,240
Scott: He's done two successful shows so far.

763
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,220
Rym: Not only that, look at his credits.

764
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,739
Rym: He is one of the old guard people who clearly worked under other people and learn the trade the old way.

765
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,878
Scott: What else did he work on?

766
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:17,000
Rym: He he did like animation for X driver.

767
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,900
Rym: He was the series director.

768
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,840
Scott: X driver.

769
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,037
Rym: For Fancy Lala.

770
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:20,920
Rym: All right.

771
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,679
Rym: He did a Lupin.

772
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,090
Rym: He did a Lupin.

773
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,339
Scott: If you haven't done a Lupin, you're not an anime.

774
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,939
Rym: Here's the thing.

775
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:27,159
Rym: The thing that we always look for.

776
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,059
Rym: And this is the secret.

777
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,160
Scott: Even Steve Bennett did Lupin.

778
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,739
Rym: If you find a guy who directed something and you see that he did like the key animation for a bunch of old stuff.

779
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,238
Rym: He's probably one of the protege's.

780
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:40,140
Rym: He did the key animation for one of the Ursa Yatsura movies.

781
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,049
Scott: Yeah.

782
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,060
Rym: And he directed a bunch of other stuff and he's all over the place.

783
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:54,330
Rym: But I think he is that these two are the, you know, Dora and Bakano are the shows where he is finally like, I'm directing and I will continue to direct stuff like this until I die.

784
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,339
Scott: I look forward to his next work, which I hope actually comes to be.

785
00:35:58,945 --> 00:35:59,900
Scott: And I hope he is not fired.

786
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,620
Rym: Go back and watch the end of Fancy Lala.

787
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:02,320
Rym: Yeah.

788
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:05,940
Rym: Scott, he was the series director.

789
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,100
Scott: Oh, I will.

790
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,559
Scott: I will let you go tell me the secret of the dinosaurs.

791
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,219
Rym: He storyboarded the first and last episodes.

792
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:12,855
Scott: Okay.

793
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,160
Rym: He also directed the first and last episode.

794
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,679
Scott: When you figure out the secret of the dinosaurs, just come tell me.

795
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,959
Rym: You realize once I know the secret of the dinosaurs, I'm going to tell you that I know it and I'm not going to tell you it.

796
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,639
Scott: I'll just stab you with a pen near the eye, but kind of miss.

797
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,240
Scott: While I'm wearing my limited edition.

798
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:43,459
Rym: Unlike Dora, Bakano, you know, if someone has seen none of it and you're trying to tell them what it's about without spoiling anything or spoiling kind of the big reveals of the show or even the early kind of, oh, that's what the show's like.

799
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,716
Rym: Bakano is very easy.

800
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,060
Rym: It's about, you know, immortal gangsters who are awesome.

801
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,996
Rym: Let's rock.

802
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:49,592
Scott: Hmm.

803
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:59,715
Rym: Dora is about a bunch of people living in a district of around Tokyo, like an urban area, Ikebukuro.

804
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,480
Scott: Okay.

805
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,260
Rym: I just, it's not relevant and interesting things happen.

806
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:18,499
Scott: Well, more, more in, I think a better explanation is that there are people that live in Ikebukuro and things are pretty interesting because it's a happening kind of place, but there's all these urban legends and they're real, but they're real.

807
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,518
Scott: All of them.

808
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:25,180
Scott: So it's like people always whispering about the, oh, the, there's a secret gang called the dollars.

809
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:25,936
Scott: Yeah, there really is.

810
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:27,220
Scott: Uh, oh man.

811
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Scott: There's a, there's a headless biker.

812
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:29,776
Scott: Yeah, there really is.

813
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:30,439
Scott: You know?

814
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,260
Rym: And it's like, or that black Russian guy who sells the sushi.

815
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:34,980
Rym: He is crazy dangerous.

816
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,260
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,120
Rym: He really backstory.

818
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:36,513
Rym: Yeah.

819
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,800
Rym: Shizu Oh, dressed like a bartender.

820
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:40,360
Rym: Fucking beats people to death.

821
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:40,470
Rym: Yep.

822
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:40,936
Rym: Right there.

823
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:41,193
Scott: Yep.

824
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,617
Scott: Yeah, he does.

825
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:42,420
Scott: He's crazy.

826
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:42,800
Scott: Super strong.

827
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,600
Scott: You know, and it's, it's basically, you mix, you take these urban legends, you know, they're not, I don't know if these are real urban legends.

828
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,899
Scott: I've never heard of them before.

829
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:53,000
Scott: So it's like they made up a bunch of urban legends for the show.

830
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,939
Scott: And then they all have something supernatural in nature and they're all for reals.

831
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:05,600
Scott: And you have this huge cast of characters like you have in a movie like snatch and they all get mixed up in all sorts of different directions as crazy things happen.

832
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,520
Scott: And you know, there isn't really a quote, main characters.

833
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,840
Scott: Some are more main than others.

834
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,280
Scott: Some have the spotlight more than others argued that seltie is the main care.

835
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
Scott: It can also be argued that the main character.

836
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:20,960
Rym: So, or you could argue that there are two main characters.

837
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,460
Rym: The first is seltie because she is like the overarching plot driver.

838
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:28,639
Scott: She's also the driver of the time, but some of the time she's barely in it.

839
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,500
Rym: But, but she's still like, her story still ties them together in, in many, many ways.

840
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:33,820
Scott: Yeah.

841
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,500
Rym: But the other main character is the, the triumvirate of the three characters.

842
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,860
Scott: Well, there's also right.

843
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:51,460
Scott: Isiah, who is like the bad guy, but he's like always in everyone's business, you know, it's like, no matter which, no matter which of the plots is going on, he's always into it.

844
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,680
Scott: He's got his hands in there.

845
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:00,820
Scott: So could it be, you know, really, it's like, he's never way in the front, but that's just cause they don't want to reveal all his secrets, but he's always there.

846
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:10,999
Scott: It's like the supporting guy who's, you know, if he's there all the time and all these other main people have a greater spotlight, but they come and go, maybe he's equal to them in, you know, mainness.

847
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,720
Rym: But it's a show that moves very quickly sometimes and slowly at other times.

848
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:19,260
Rym: But the end result is it's not a show that's easily predicted.

849
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,446
Rym: You can predict like certain major plot points, like you can with any show, but the show will kind of just story for a loop.

850
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:28,551
Rym: or they'll ask a question like, what is the secret of the, Oh, it's this.

851
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:29,657
Rym: Now what?

852
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,359
Scott: And the other thing is that there's a lot of times where you know something, but different characters don't know it.

853
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,379
Scott: So it's like, Oh, he knows, I know all these things, but he only knows this subset and he only knows this subset.

854
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:49,059
Scott: And all, if only these characters would all just tell each other what I know, they all know that they know that the other person doesn't know that they know.

855
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:59,760
Rym: So at the end of the first story arc, there's one big reveal of, Oh, that's not so and so that's so and so I didn't see that one coming.

856
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,358
Rym: I did that when that, when that whole reveal happened, basically it comes down to a bunch of people standing around going, what the fuck?

857
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,979
Scott: There's pretty much really, there was pretty much only one thing and I predicted it way early and the proof is in the forum.

858
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,597
Scott: And did in fact predicted, I predicted it absolutely 100% way early and everything else I didn't predict.

859
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:23,639
Scott: So I got, I got one, but it was a big one and no one else got it.

860
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,628
Rym: So who should watch the show before?

861
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:26,653
Rym: we, you know, have a little.

862
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:31,580
Scott: everybody except except very small children and maybe old people won't like it.

863
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:35,539
Rym: I think small children would like at least the first season about like two year olds.

864
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:38,420
Rym: It's pretty and colorful and stuff's going around.

865
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,840
Scott: It's kind of dark stuff's lying around.

866
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:46,318
Scott: I was like 10 year olds and up from 10 to like, you know, I mean old people should watch it, but they probably won't like it.

867
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,774
Scott: So maybe like 10 to 60 year olds.

868
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,100
Rym: I was eight when I saw vampire hunter D and I loved it.

869
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:55,340
Rym: My little brother was five, five, I don't know.

870
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:55,992
Rym: He loved it.

871
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,079
Rym: Vampire hunter D was the best thing ever when he was five years old.

872
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,439
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.

873
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,059
Scott: He's going to really understand what's going on when he's five.

874
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,000
Rym: Just colorful, just colors running around.

875
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,376
Scott: Okay.

876
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,960
Scott: But you can get more colors if you watch Pokemon.

877
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:11,920
Scott: Or, uh, that's got way too many colors.

878
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:14,439
Scott: Stick with the Doraemon when you're five.

879
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:19,079
Scott: In fact, stick with Doraemon until you're like in second, third, second, third grade.

880
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,559
Rym: Just don't watch Doraemon.

881
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,120
Scott: Dude, there's your, there's your mashup.

882
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,220
Rym: Yeah.

883
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,040
Rym: He just Doraemon shows up and he takes off her helmet and it's just Doraemon.

884
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:45,679
Rym: So not to spoil anything, but this helicopter straight up and the way the show goes is, you know, there's the first episode and the second episode are really cool and they set up all this stuff.

885
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
Rym: But then the mystery is who is the headless rider?

886
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,257
Rym: What's the deal?

887
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,480
Rym: Is she really headless right away?

888
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,920
Rym: They answer that straight up and she is just a character from that point forward.

889
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,180
Scott: It's like, it's like, Ooh, there's a mysterious headless rider.

890
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:00,179
Scott: Then like w w like episode four or five.

891
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,660
Scott: It's like the headless rider.

892
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:01,934
Scott: Hello.

893
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:02,798
Rym: She's just cool.

894
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,360
Scott: I'm hanging out in my house.

895
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,298
Scott: I'm the headless rider.

896
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:06,399
Rym: She's scared of aliens.

897
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,120
Rym: She talks to people with an iPhone.

898
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,030
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,317
Scott: It's like, what's up?

900
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,804
Scott: Someone's like, they don't like, it's not like one of the other characters discovers it.

901
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,440
Scott: It's like this.

902
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,740
Scott: Suddenly there's an episode just focusing on that character and just reveals all at least reveals most.

903
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,480
Rym: And then later someone's like, show me what's under your helmet.

904
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:20,998
Rym: She was like, okay.

905
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,639
Rym: And he's like, Oh, okay, cool.

906
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:23,558
Scott: All right, let's go.

907
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:24,860
Scott: I see what's under that helmet.

908
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,219
Rym: I see what you did there.

909
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,532
Rym: Yeah.

910
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:27,415
Scott: Okay.

911
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,820
Scott: So I don't know how the helmet stays on.

912
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,880
Scott: That's my problem.

913
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:35,480
Rym: Well, she, her clothes, everything else stays on and half of it was formed by her magic.

914
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Scott: That's cause she has a body.

915
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,320
Rym: But she forms her clothes with magic.

916
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,620
Rym: Remember?

917
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:39,560
Scott: Oh, right.

918
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,659
Rym: She makes all those other helmets.

919
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,680
Scott: No, that's right.

920
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:41,933
Rym: Yeah.

921
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,360
Rym: That's right.

922
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,434
Scott: I forgot about that.

923
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:44,420
Scott: Magic.

924
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,579
Scott: He has a lot of magic in this show.

925
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:49,300
Rym: Not as much as you'd think, unless you count the internet as being magic.

926
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,479
Scott: The internet is magic.

927
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,018
Rym: It's funny cause you know, some characters like Salty has powers straight up and she's a little of the strong guy.

928
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:56,934
Rym: Technically.

929
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,018
Rym: It's not so much that he has powers, but she's just kicked so much ass.

930
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,460
Scott: It's so awesome.

931
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,477
Scott: Oh my God.

932
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
Scott: Some awesome people cosplaying issues as well.

933
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,520
Scott: And it's actually cool cosplay.

934
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,780
Scott: Cause instead of carrying around a big stupid sword, you carry on like a signpost or whatever, or like the railroad sign.

935
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,232
Scott: I saw some guys at Connecticut doing that.

936
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:17,659
Scott: cosplay is pretty good.

937
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,058
Rym: Plus his, I love his backstory and there's a scene where he gets, I can't spoil it, but it's awesome.

938
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:26,359
Rym: You should watch this show.

939
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:27,640
Rym: Anyone will like this show.

940
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,040
Rym: It's a cowboy beboppy show.

941
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,320
Rym: We're pretty much, it's not quite as good as not in terms of goodness, but in terms of it's fun, it takes you along for a ride.

942
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:38,539
Rym: It's both serious and funny.

943
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:39,580
Rym: Good start.

944
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,340
Rym: Good soundtrack.

945
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,440
Rym: It kind of fades into the background.

946
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,319
Rym: Just accents the point.

947
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:45,399
Rym: It's no, uh, Yoko Kanno soundtrack, but it's there.

948
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,619
Rym: The openings, the first opener I really, really like.

949
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:49,118
Rym: Yeah.

950
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:49,760
Rym: Second opener.

951
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:56,156
Scott: The only thing I can say that's negative about the show really is that it pulls the Prince of nothing right away.

952
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Rym: They're like, there's going to be a holy war and the whole series ends.

953
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,000
Rym: And it's basically, we're almost at the holy war.

954
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,519
Scott: Well, I think it's because you're only getting two.

955
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,020
Scott: That was the negative thing is you're only getting two of the light novel.

956
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,120
Scott: So you're not getting the whole story.

957
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:19,520
Scott: So even though each individual light novel sort of wraps itself up and at the end of series, you get closure.

958
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,920
Scott: You don't get the full closure because you only have two out of X parts, you know?

959
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:32,279
Scott: So it's like, if you're watching the star wars, any individual star wars movie stands on its own and has an ending to itself.

960
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:40,580
Scott: But if you only watch episode four and you don't watch five and six, it's like, well, like we don't get any ending here.

961
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:56,538
Rym: Look at, uh, you know, the Lord of the rings, the first movie, or much more importantly, if the empire strikes back stands on its own, except as a kid watching that, not having seen like all of the first movie and not knowing there was the third movie, that ending is basically what the fuck?

962
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:57,859
Rym: Really?

963
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,698
Rym: That's how it ends.

964
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:00,920
Rym: Nothing.

965
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,680
Rym: No one won and they just run away.

966
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,876
Scott: Cause I know that guy's on.

967
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,549
Scott: Yeah.

968
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:12,810
Rym: When my dad was like, there's a third movie, you know, Okay.

969
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:29,419
Rym: But before we move on to a couple of spoilers, I'll say this, the dirt has a plot in the kind of the first 13 episodes or so that resolves itself in a very satisfying way and answers many, but not all of the questions.

970
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:35,680
Rym: The second season raises a whole different set of questions and answers most of them.

971
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,080
Scott: The first season, you know, relies a lot on the fact that it's introducing all these characters.

972
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,239
Scott: So it can make most of the plot being revealing the characters.

973
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:55,220
Scott: Once all the characters are revealed, the rest of the series is about the conflicts between the characters unfolding and switching and whatnot.

974
00:45:55,541 --> 00:46:03,339
Rym: It works because every character in this show is the short guy wearing a white suit in that Simpsons episode with the Chinese and the Yakuza and all the fighting.

975
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,837
Rym: Yep.

976
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,539
Rym: Because every character is kind of just there.

977
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,080
Rym: And then they have their moment where you find out how completely crazily bad-ass or scary they are or both bad-ass crazy.

978
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,180
Rym: I think my favorite characters are the van people.

979
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:19,179
Scott: They're pretty good.

980
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,339
Rym: Like all of them together because they compete with Russian sushi.

981
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:26,900
Rym: I don't know the tasty, the van people are just like, yeah, let's go.

982
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,580
Scott: But then there's the head guy.

983
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:30,934
Scott: What's it?

984
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,240
Scott: I forget his name, but he's just, he's just awesome.

985
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:33,580
Scott: Right.

986
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:36,520
Scott: And then there's the two, the Otaku in the back of the van.

987
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,859
Rym: But they're crazy awesome when they want to be.

988
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,599
Scott: But there's the fourth guy in the van.

989
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:41,219
Scott: It's like, what?

990
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,179
Scott: He's just sort of there.

991
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,280
Rym: He's the van driver.

992
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:43,791
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,160
Scott: It's like, what's, I don't know.

994
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,798
Scott: I don't get his deal.

995
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:48,139
Rym: He's the, he's the initial D drive and getaway guy.

996
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,673
Scott: Maybe.

997
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,310
Scott: I don't know.

998
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:50,760
Scott: Anyway.

999
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,939
Scott: The show is great.

1000
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,380
Rym: So we're going to spoil some shit about the first season now, just so we can talk about it to make this worthwhile.

1001
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,518
Rym: The people who listen to our preview and already watched the show.

1002
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:03,680
Rym: So spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

1003
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,980
Scott: Oh my God, everybody dies.

1004
00:47:07,565 --> 00:47:08,559
Scott: And the show resets.

1005
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,160
Rym: Yeah.

1006
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,379
Rym: It was all just a fucking dream.

1007
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,180
Scott: So anyway, the thing that I predicted correctly, right.

1008
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:16,560
Scott: Was that a Mikado is the head of the dollar.

1009
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,114
Rym: Yup.

1010
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,611
Rym: And that was, it was so obvious because completely normal guy.

1011
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:23,719
Scott: Right.

1012
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:27,255
Scott: And you have this whole, during the show, there's always this internet typing going on.

1013
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:27,760
Scott: Right.

1014
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:32,700
Scott: And he comes into town and he's totally boring, but there's this dollars thing.

1015
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,039
Scott: And it's like, oh, well, obviously this normal guy, right.

1016
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,940
Scott: There has to be something about him.

1017
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
Scott: That's crazy secret.

1018
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:40,380
Scott: Awesome.

1019
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,900
Scott: Just like there is for every other character in the show has a secret.

1020
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,260
Scott: Awesome.

1021
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:45,620
Scott: And he's the only one who doesn't look like he has a secret.

1022
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,000
Scott: Awesome.

1023
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,420
Scott: But the only thing in the show that isn't already attached to somebody is the dollars.

1024
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:52,740
Scott: It's like, well, what's the dollars.

1025
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:53,837
Scott: It's this thing.

1026
00:47:54,981 --> 00:47:56,380
Scott: Obviously that secret.

1027
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:56,820
Scott: Awesome.

1028
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,980
Scott: That's just sort of unattached attaches to the guy without any secret.

1029
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,338
Scott: Awesome.

1030
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,039
Scott: That's, that's just there.

1031
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,957
Scott: That's how it goes.

1032
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,980
Scott: You know, everyone else has something to go with already.

1033
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:10,039
Scott: That is, you know, already, they're already got their stick.

1034
00:48:10,445 --> 00:48:11,098
Scott: He didn't have a stick.

1035
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,519
Scott: There's a stick without a person.

1036
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:14,620
Scott: The person with no stick stick with a person.

1037
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:14,894
Scott: Boom.

1038
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:15,460
Scott: Done.

1039
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,289
Rym: But also I like how, you know, people all have these kind of powers, whatever they may be.

1040
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,579
Rym: And his power is basically.

1041
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,060
Rym: Fortune.

1042
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,620
Scott: It's a good power to have, especially when it actually works.

1043
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,700
Rym: It makes it really interesting the way he used it.

1044
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:36,970
Rym: Like that was the moment when the show went from just being really, really fun to also being like really, really well executed.

1045
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:42,018
Rym: the way he uses the fortune power and the end of that, you know, and then all the reveals happen.

1046
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,540
Scott: But then in the second half of the show, he starts to use it a little more frivolously.

1047
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:45,979
Scott: Oh yeah.

1048
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,559
Scott: Still to great effect, but not like the first time.

1049
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:56,720
Rym: Well, the first time that moment, just when everyone's looking at their phones and then they all look up and all the people who aren't looking at their phones, they're like, uh.

1050
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,559
Rym: It's kind of a, that's the way the world is and is going to be.

1051
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:06,895
Scott: I hope so.

1052
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,536
Rym: Yeah.

1053
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,180
Rym: Fortune.

1054
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:12,839
Scott: The other thing I thought was really interesting was the whole psycho thing, right?

1055
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,680
Rym: It's like that I did not expect.

1056
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:20,820
Rym: When she got away and I was like, how the fuck did she get away?

1057
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:23,620
Rym: But I didn't think maybe I should try to figure it out.

1058
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,739
Rym: I just thought how the fuck.

1059
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,100
Rym: And then when they revealed, oh, duh.

1060
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:27,973
Scott: Yeah.

1061
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,430
Scott: But the thing that got me is that it's like, okay, someone's possessed by an evil sword, right?

1062
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,480
Scott: But it's like, it's not the typical situation when you have that.

1063
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:40,100
Scott: Usually when someone's possessed by an evil thing, it's like the one ring, right?

1064
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,240
Scott: This was like, yeah, I got the one ring, but you know what?

1065
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:44,319
Scott: I got it under control.

1066
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:44,798
Scott: It's cool.

1067
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:46,300
Scott: And it totally is cool.

1068
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,540
Scott: Like she's, she's got it, but she's not, you know, going crazy or stabbing people.

1069
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:56,493
Scott: You know, it was only someone else who had a problem that became all crazy toward the end.

1070
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,419
Rym: She starts using it semi-frivolously too.

1071
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:58,980
Scott: Yeah.

1072
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,655
Scott: But they, they show you the contrast between the slasher and her of like, yeah, this is what usually happens when there's someone possessed by an evil weapon.

1073
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:10,497
Scott: and here's how our person upset possessed by an evil weapon is going to be right.

1074
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:11,457
Scott: You know?

1075
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:15,398
Scott: And it's like, ah, I'd like to think that if I was possessed by an evil weapon, I'll be more like that.

1076
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,020
Scott: You know, I wouldn't be all just like crazy, stabbing everybody.

1077
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:37,200
Rym: So I guess the last thing before we end the show, cause we've gone on long enough toward the end when in case someone's still listening, I'm not going to say who, but anyone who knows knows when someone gets fucking shot at the end of an episode, the fact that, and now I'm spoiling in the next episode, they don't address it for a while.

1078
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,820
Rym: And then the fucker just kind of wanders into the scene.

1079
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,078
Rym: He's like, someone shot me.

1080
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:42,179
Scott: What the hell?

1081
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,438
Rym: I walked here.

1082
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:44,360
Scott: Yeah.

1083
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,859
Scott: I thought he was, I thought he was done.

1084
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,919
Rym: I thought he was done too.

1085
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,120
Scott: And I was, I was upset because I was an awesome character.

1086
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,080
Scott: I wanted to stick around.

1087
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,200
Scott: But then when he came back, I was also sort of upset that it was not a for real death.

1088
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,100
Rym: I was also happy because that was fucking hilarious.

1089
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,080
Rym: That was, it was really like, like epic, like crazy scene.

1090
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,580
Rym: Like someone got shot.

1091
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,660
Rym: Things really got escalated.

1092
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:07,379
Rym: And then he just comes in and he's just so bad ass.

1093
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,220
Scott: The thing is guns are always a much bigger deal in Japan.

1094
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:10,759
Scott: Real ones.

1095
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,140
Scott: Anyway, then they are in the, you know, in us media.

1096
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:20,513
Scott: It's like when you see a gun coming out and like, you know, an anime that takes place in what's supposedly modern Japan, shit, you know, daughter dies.

1097
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,159
Rym: So Sasa in the movie, nobody has a gun.

1098
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:27,560
Scott: And they're all, it's a cop movie.

1099
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,639
Rym: I remember the scene where I forget if it was the first movie or maybe it was the rainbow bridge where that crazy person has a gun and none of the police have a gun.

1100
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,297
Scott: Nope.

1101
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:39,173
Scott: And then, you know, there's the, the, the big scene and those.

1102
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:41,200
Scott: that is a fricking stabbing, right?

1103
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:41,979
Scott: It's like, Oh shit.

1104
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,553
Scott: A knife.

1105
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:43,814
Scott: Ah, Hey.

1106
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:44,432
Scott: Yeah.

1107
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,000
Rym: So it was better than one knife tuna.

1108
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,037
Rym: Oh yeah.

1109
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:49,620
Rym: I think we're done.

1110
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:50,393
Rym: We can wrap this up.

1111
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:51,999
Scott: You should watch the show.

1112
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,680
Scott: It's I think it's still free on crunchy roll.

1113
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,940
Scott: There's going to be some sort of OAV like epilogue.

1114
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,080
Scott: That's going to come out, which is like, Oh really?

1115
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,440
Scott: Cause I guess that means that they're not going to do the remaining.

1116
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:03,918
Rym: I think they will.

1117
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,300
Rym: I think maybe they'll just do OAVs for a while.

1118
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,778
Rym: We'll see.

1119
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:07,396
Scott: I don't know.

1120
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,400
Rym: It's hard to tell.

1121
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,837
Rym: I don't know what the sales are like.

1122
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,080
Scott: I'm more looking forward to just the guy directing more different animes.

1123
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,320
Scott: Cause I can, you know, I can get the light novels for this, right?

1124
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,900
Scott: But also find the rest of the story.

1125
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,160
Rym: If you haven't watched it, watch Baccano.

1126
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,220
Rym: If you like Dora, you'll like Baccano and the other way around.

1127
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,420
Scott: But I still didn't finish Baccano.

1128
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,560
Scott: I only watched a handful episodes.

1129
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,800
Rym: I've seen all, but like the last three episodes.

1130
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,418
Scott: Oh, right.

1131
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:28,080
Scott: I thought you saw it all.

1132
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,479
Rym: It's fricking awesome.

1133
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,556
Scott: I've only watched like a hand, like three or four and I've got to, I've just got to go forward.

1134
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:37,120
Rym: It is a lot more violent than Dora Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara.

1135
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,600
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1136
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,719
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1137
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1138
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,060
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1139
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,840
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1141
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:11,640
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1142
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,740
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
