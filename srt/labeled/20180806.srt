00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,000
Scott:

2
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:11,771
Rym: It's Monday August 6th 2018.

3
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:12,193
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,300
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:16,219
Rym: keyboard shortcuts.

6
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,258
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:23,089
Rym: So I'm not one to complain about the heat.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:23,993
Rym: I'm the opposite of that.

9
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:26,040
Rym: I'm pretty much always complaining that it's not hot enough.

10
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,003
Scott: Yeah, I don't complain.

11
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:27,846
Rym: I'd like it to be really.

12
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:38,071
Scott: I don't ever complain about heat or humidity because even if it does get a Point where it's even slightly uncomfortable, but I just remember that anyway I just imagine it being cold again, and I'm like well.

13
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:38,653
Scott: I'll take this.

14
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:42,027
Scott: yeah, no question It's like even a hundred.

15
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:46,122
Scott: something degrees is more comfortable than like 40.

16
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:50,976
Rym: Yeah, in fact 40 is the worst because if it's like zero I can go skin fuck ski.

17
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:58,520
Rym: if it's a hundred I can enjoy the heat, but if it's like 40 I both can't ski and can't go outside.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,695
Rym: But I think you can do nothing.

19
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:05,280
Scott: even though I like heat the thing that I actually don't like is the bright sun with its evil burn.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,008
Rym: The bright Sun is that like.

21
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:09,780
Rym: that is literally the primary aspect of why I like the heat.

22
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,998
Scott: I want it to be dark and a hundred degrees.

23
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:13,659
Rym: I do enjoy that.

24
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:21,454
Rym: One of my favorite things on earth is to go for a long road or a long bike ride in the middle of the night When it's really hot at night.

25
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,400
Scott: the point is today.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,200
Scott: It was one of those situations where it was nice and super toasty everywhere to the point at which most people were uncomfortable.

27
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:33,816
Scott: I was very comfortable, but in the Sun you could feel it like burning.

28
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,260
Scott: you you probably could have cooked food outside.

29
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:37,467
Rym: Yeah, but I like that.

30
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:37,829
Rym: I like that.

31
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,512
Rym: I like to run.

32
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,658
Rym: It's like shorts.

33
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,130
Scott: No shirt I like it was.

34
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,574
Scott: I like that.

35
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:45,016
Scott: it was warm But then I had to go in the shade and I was disappointed in the shade.

36
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:50,205
Scott: good that it was colder But I was happy in the shade that it was less bright And it was a I had to basically couldn't.

37
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:55,360
Scott: it was either too bright and warm enough or slightly cold and but not bright.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,773
Rym: But so I've been trying to run half marathons like every weekend.

39
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:00,998
Rym: I'm trying to get my times down.

40
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:01,560
Scott: Is that healthy?

41
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,288
Rym: Yeah, there's a full marathon.

42
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:07,840
Rym: see like there's some evidence that if you do that a lot it'll cause joint damage.

43
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:11,494
Scott: How far can I bike before it counts as a marathon?

44
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:16,352
Rym: Ah biking so far You'll be worried more about things like incontinence and impotence.

45
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,320
Scott: I mean, that's just gonna happen when I'm old anyway.

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,500
Rym: Yeah, biking can cause specific issues there, especially if you use a fancy narrow-ass bike seat, but I digress.

47
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:35,600
Rym: so I Started my run on Saturday like I usually do but it was hot And more importantly I thought the rain ended like the air quality be good.

48
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:44,094
Rym: The air quality was actually really bad and caught is real bad Yeah, and I hit about the 10-mile mark and my lungs were just like hey Rym.

49
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,987
Rym: Yeah now you should stop You're gonna be in bed You're gonna not have a good time if you don't stop.

50
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:55,849
Rym: and I did stop and then I was just exhausted and tired for the entire Rest of the day Probably because of the ozone in the air.

51
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,080
Scott: Well, you were all getting drinking poison.

52
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:58,724
Scott: I went to that.

53
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:04,149
Scott: I just went to bike around and I just went to the park cuz whatever Run should we actually between?

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,019
Rym: all of us drank relatively little poison?

55
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,165
Scott: More than zero poison.

56
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,570
Rym: Yeah, we all had like one beer.

57
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:18,856
Rym: a couple of people had to one home a giant mug of poison yeah, and Giant gypsy toast covered in fruit and jam and it was amazing.

58
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:22,466
Scott: Anyway, and also it's Cavazas, I biked around the park.

59
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:27,083
Scott: I'm just whooshing around in a circle and like my legs are like, whatever You're just going to stupid.

60
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,372
Rym: I will not use fair Celsius.

61
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:31,118
Rym: Fahrenheit is superior and I'll fight you.

62
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:31,520
Rym: That's the hill.

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:31,961
Rym: I'll die.

64
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:32,584
Scott: Anyway, am I?

65
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:44,484
Scott: and but like every time I went up the hill my my lung was like My leg was like Isn't even barely a hill?

66
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:44,725
Scott: I'm not.

67
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:47,254
Scott: you know how many gears we can go lower than this.

68
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:50,989
Rym: to quote a legendary comedian Don't breathe no more.

69
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,659
Scott: Yeah, that was when he's talking about having a heart attack.

70
00:03:53,402 --> 00:04:02,379
Rym: But there's there's the point when your body instead of cuz pain is normally a suggestion like hey You should probably knock this out like stop this like this is this is not good.

71
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:06,820
Rym: But then there's when the body instead of saying hey stop it the body gives a directive.

72
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:10,415
Scott: There's one guy was biking and I passed him on the way into the park.

73
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:15,553
Scott: Yeah, and he was playing Some really awful like 2000s pop song.

74
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,380
Scott: Yeah, and then I didn't see him again.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,608
Scott: But then I kept going around and I did.

76
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:28,497
Scott: I caught up to him and he was playing staying alive And then so I tried to like bike next to him so I could listen.

77
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:35,163
Scott: groove to the stand a lot Yeah, and then we got to the hill and then he was way slower And I like.

78
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:39,220
Scott: I tried to slow down to hear more music, but I couldn't slow down that much.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,768
Rym: So a real sad thing.

80
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,356
Scott: happy weird like if I hit the brakes.

81
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,100
Scott: just this guy.

82
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,225
Rym: So This dude was biking.

83
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:51,879
Rym: He was like our age and like seemed fit and he was honored like a kind of normal bike.

84
00:04:52,461 --> 00:05:01,566
Rym: But I beat him over the RFK bridge on foot and he was biking the entire time both up and downhill On the uphill.

85
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,339
Rym: He was clearly in the wrong gear and didn't know how bikes work.

86
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,263
Rym: So he was.

87
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:10,860
Scott: he was like jumping into like so many wrong gear people and I don't know how to help them.

88
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,860
Rym: And if they're it's not even like you only had one gear he had.

89
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,250
Scott: No, I don't stop I don't even think about helping someone if they don't have a gear.

90
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:29,270
Scott: but the other thing is that if I see someone in a Bad gear and I want to help them like even if I try to help them like they don't Listen, and even if and if I'm afraid especially if they're not a man that it'll be mansplaining Yeah, I don't.

91
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:31,865
Scott: it's not an explain It's like how do you balance that?

92
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:42,286
Scott: not wanting to mansplain but also want genuinely wanting to help people because if they did stop And listen to me and I gave him like a two-minute lesson on how to use the fucking gears They could go whoosh in.

93
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:43,473
Scott: their life would be so much better.

94
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,820
Rym: Yeah, I gave up on helping people.

95
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,479
Rym: I only talk to people if I'm making fun of them for their the fact that they only have one gear.

96
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:55,760
Rym: Usually my advice will be you know You could go a lot faster uphill if you had more than one gear and they get really mad and then I bike away.

97
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,419
Rym: They can't catch me because they only have one gear.

98
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:08,059
Rym: But usually when I'm running Fixie dudes will go real slow like I'll pass them because they can't bike faster than I can run uphill But then they'll pass me on the downhill cuz on a bike.

99
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:15,732
Rym: This dude not only couldn't get up the hill because he was in the wrong gear But then he couldn't go down the hill at speed.

100
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:20,492
Rym: I think he was braking the whole time So I basically ran down the RFK faster than him.

101
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,760
Scott: Was he just not afraid to pass you cuz it's too narrow?

102
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,486
Rym: Oh, no, he I left him in the dust.

103
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:28,240
Rym: Okay, I actually stopped at the bottom of the bridge partly because the ozone.

104
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,119
Rym: That's when I hit the 10-mile mark and I was running out of steam.

105
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:37,860
Rym: So I waited to the bottom of the bridge like catching my breath and drinking water and he came down like four minutes after me.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,589
Scott: well, so if He has to go down the stairs.

107
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,807
Rym: Maybe he was clumsy with the bike on the stairs He might have been he might have been but he even on the downhill before we hit the stairs Never got up with me.

108
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,040
Rym: It was the first time in my life I passed a biker on the uphill on foot and then they did not catch up to me on the downhill.

109
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,219
Scott: You know someone slow when I'm coasting not even pedaling uphill and I'm passing them.

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,927
Rym: Yeah, I ran into that too.

111
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,259
Scott: That happens more than you would think.

112
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,771
Scott: Somebody's pedaling a bike next to me but they don't know how to bike and they don't know how to use gears even if they're fit.

113
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:16,920
Scott: and I stopped pedaling and Still my velocities remains greater than theirs and I just keep going past them without the moral of this.

114
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:24,240
Rym: Is that the most assured way to enrage a New Yorker or at least to get our interest in a negative fashion in the way?

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,426
Rym: Is to be slow in any capacity?

116
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,360
Rym: you're moving slowly on in on foot or on a bicycle.

117
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,200
Rym: Yeah, that is a problem.

118
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:38,440
Rym: So there's actually a lot of tech news.

119
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:42,540
Rym: I don't think we'll go into these too deep, but I'll start with Scott's this Vanity Fair article, right?

120
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,100
Scott: So basically, I think Steve Jobs daughter Lisa the one that the Lisa computer was or was not named after I think she wrote a memoir.

121
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,900
Scott: There's the excerpt of it, which is mostly the parts about Steve Jobs that's on Vanity Fair.

122
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,080
Scott: That's the only part you're gonna be interested in for tech news, right?

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,068
Scott: yeah, but it's you can see what you can like.

124
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:14,474
Scott: this is the most learn what Steve Jobs is really like kind of thing and This really matches my Basically existing assumptions based on his like public persona.

125
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:23,259
Scott: Yeah, and also my assumptions about all Silicon Valley douche bag And all rich people which is fuck them.

126
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,994
Rym: yeah, I You know, I think there should be a maximum wage.

127
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,325
Scott: I Think there should be a lot of things.

128
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:51,673
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, if you're interested, you know, if you're interested at all and you know Steve Jobs, although I do not like him was a very important person in the history of technology and was the you know Primary reason that Apple computer is the first trillion dollar corporation to ever exist Yeah, and is now basically evil cyberpunk Co number one.

129
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:55,040
Rym: Yeah, they're like number three, I think the biggest.

130
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,084
Rym: Anyway, well, no, they have the.

131
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,669
Rym: they have the largest wine is calf.

132
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:02,380
Rym: That does not mean they're actually the biggest important person regardless.

133
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,087
Scott: You know, you should.

134
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,820
Scott: you should learn about him.

135
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,320
Scott: They care about technologies and this is about as close to learn about his personality.

136
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,674
Scott: You know someone who was half shared half his DNA is or whatever.

137
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:19,112
Rym: Oh, yeah right in the summary here It describes him as mercurial and it sounds about right.

138
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,348
Rym: I'm sure I read this Mercurial.

139
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:23,138
Rym: things will happen.

140
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:25,271
Rym: So there's some other news.

141
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:32,700
Rym: if you were paying attention today You might have seen a lot of articles that all said leak says Microsoft's gonna charge a monthly fee for Windows.

142
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:34,104
Scott: I didn't see that.

143
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,353
Rym: This was all over the internet like a little while ago.

144
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,540
Scott: Okay, I guess I actually did some work today.

145
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,754
Rym: Oh, yeah, we both have newest jobs and we're both actually doing work.

146
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:44,697
Scott: I read plenty in it.

147
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:49,051
Rym: Yeah, but So one that is not true and the mean.

148
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:50,676
Scott: if it was I definitely would find a way.

149
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:57,100
Scott: every time there have been throughout Microsoft Windows history There have always been like oh no Windows is gonna be even eviler now.

150
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,148
Scott: Oh, no, oh no, and in the?

151
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,079
Scott: oh, no never happened really Yeah.

152
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:09,857
Rym: Or some of the things that a lot of people say oh they'll do this evil thing Were things they should do like forcing people to upgrade Like I think they should force people to take their patches.

153
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,075
Scott: Fuck you I think so, too.

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,059
Rym: So the actual story here and it really is funny how many?

155
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,715
Rym: Scare mongering articles really had no idea what the deal was.

156
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:21,860
Rym: It's pretty straightforward.

157
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,119
Scott: I gotta get it clicks and I get it clicks of the real story.

158
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:31,440
Rym: So Microsoft is probably going to offer a managed service for Windows PCs aimed at companies.

159
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,051
Rym: This is not aimed at like you and your house or your tiny company.

160
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,920
Rym: This is aimed at a company that's big enough.

161
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,960
Scott: I mean Windows is already dying in the end people's houses because everyone just uses their phone and tablet.

162
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,920
Scott: Yeah, so even if they they did this people would just like stop using the desktops all together.

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,836
Scott: They would just all go to.

164
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:48,020
Scott: yeah.

165
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:48,825
Scott: So why would they do?

166
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:51,020
Scott: why would they kill off the remaining whatever they got left?

167
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,880
Rym: Yeah, cuz the only reason to run Windows is that new surface tablet that's smaller.

168
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,787
Scott: That's supposed to be way good like surface go.

169
00:10:56,988 --> 00:11:00,240
Rym: if you don't need the like high performance of a regular surface device.

170
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,944
Rym: This thing's great.

171
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,856
Scott: It actually seems pretty good from what people are saying.

172
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,520
Scott: I haven't seen one.

173
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:09,240
Rym: I would consider getting it when my laptop dies because it could do everything my current laptop does better.

174
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:15,600
Rym: It's actually way faster than my current laptop But I'll probably get the one with like the video card like the real surface.

175
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:28,040
Rym: But anyway, so the only people who use Windows at home are gamers because it's really the only PC gaming platform like there's no other way to play PC games or people who are making content and don't want to run a Mac.

176
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:34,096
Rym: And frankly if you're making content you probably want to use Windows because you can get real hardware.

177
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:45,580
Scott: like a lot of people these days They're using like hackintosh, which is a PC, but you install OS X Yeah, or they're some getting like some external GPU nonsense, or they're who knows yeah.

178
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:51,980
Scott: But anyway the real story is managed service or dealing with the slow beginning the most expensive Mac and dealing with it.

179
00:11:52,220 --> 00:12:08,799
Rym: so a company could basically pay Microsoft a monthly fee like per desk and have a Windows desktop that Microsoft will manage for you meaning group policies and Patches and updates and if an update breaks something they'll take care of it.

180
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:17,309
Scott: I think a lot of companies will jump on this because a lot of companies has to be cheaper than your IT guy or better enough that it's worth paying the extra.

181
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,140
Scott: or you know the math just has to work out and you'll switch to it because

182
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,044
Rym: a giant company

183
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:27,499
Scott: even if you have an IT guy you might even keep the IT guy on and Pay for this because now your IT guy can spend all their time doing something else.

184
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:30,815
Rym: Yep, because a lot of companies will not pay for an IT person

185
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,043
Scott: dealing with the shitty phones Yeah shitty network to

186
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:46,700
Rym: administer like their internal Active Directory or the internal desktop PCs like a lot of companies struggle with this and This is I think a really good thing for Microsoft to offer because a lot of companies offer this service on top of Microsoft.

187
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,480
Rym: They'll basically come into a company and provide managed IT services and I suspect a lot of those companies do a bad job.

188
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:58,900
Rym: so Microsoft can both take the VIG and Cut these middlemen out of the equation and provide the service directly.

189
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,555
Scott: I mean, this is the thing that's always right anytime your business is based on someone else's platform.

190
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:09,633
Scott: Yeah, right if you sell Accessories for a Toyota car Right, you know what?

191
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,146
Rym: I might start selling Toyota.

192
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,797
Scott: a might include that accessory as a feature in the cars.

193
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,025
Scott: to begin with Right be.

194
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:23,590
Scott: they might offer it as an add-on and now no one's gonna buy your third-party one Yeah, or they just might buy your whole company.

195
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,313
Scott: That's what you want.

196
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,461
Scott: And this happens all the time I remember.

197
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:34,860
Scott: the one I remember the most is some fancy Visual Studio plug-in back in the day and it was like Microsoft is gonna at threatened to add the feature to Visual Studio.

198
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:41,400
Scott: And then the basically they worked it out and Microsoft bought the plug-in company instead and then added the feature to Visual Studio.

199
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:49,120
Scott: Right, so it's just you know, it's not necessarily a software feature, but it's still a service for a particular product.

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,479
Scott: It's like well, we'll just offer the service with the product.

201
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,309
Rym: So that's all this news is there's nothing to be afraid of.

202
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,680
Rym: if you somehow heard that Microsoft is gonna charge a monthly fee for Windows.

203
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:08,638
Rym: Click even one article get one sentence into any article and you could have figured out what the real story is in some other news.

204
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:13,353
Rym: Google according to a bunch of leaks Apple Google Microsoft and Google.

205
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,560
Scott: All right, cover all the bases here.

206
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:17,082
Rym: They.

207
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:22,359
Rym: basically we're gonna launch a censored search in China.

208
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:25,476
Scott: Mm-hmm way back in the day.

209
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:38,213
Scott: way back They were in China and China was like you must censor the Google search and Google said no We're just gonna stop putting Google in China And that's why Chinese people use Baidu or QQ or whatever the other.

210
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:39,800
Scott: the alternative things are.

211
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,166
Scott: So I think it's Baidu right.

212
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:50,900
Rym: the confidential project dragonfly Was leaked to a group of Google employees wider than the tiny group of Google employees who were working on.

213
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:56,800
Scott: Tiny group of people at Google who are sudden had changed the previous Google policy and we're now willing to do this.

214
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,113
Rym: We're willing to make a censored search engine.

215
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:05,420
Scott: other Google employees We're the ones not willing to do this found out that other Google people were evil and we're doing this.

216
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,854
Rym: It seems that a lot of like Google employees freaked out demanded the project to be canceled.

217
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,860
Rym: a bunch of people threatened to quit.

218
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:14,926
Rym: There's a lot of like.

219
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:17,132
Rym: there's a lot of interesting stories about what's going.

220
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,777
Rym: this is like developing news.

221
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:19,720
Rym: This is still ongoing.

222
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:22,678
Rym: So this article will sort of cover the baseline of where we are.

223
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:33,415
Scott: But I mean even if they managed to complete it with the team of people who had no ethical more qualms Yeah, and then they deployed it then everyone would find out and quit.

224
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:34,640
Scott: you'd have the same problem later.

225
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,525
Scott: Wouldn't it be just be better?

226
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:36,371
Scott: Right?

227
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:37,196
Scott: It's like come on.

228
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,320
Rym: Yep So there's all sorts of drama about this and this is a good thing.

229
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:49,893
Rym: I'm actually very happy that people inside Google are both willing to leak this to the public and Actually quit their jobs or threaten to quit their jobs over it.

230
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,280
Scott: Well, you got a company is big enough.

231
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,609
Scott: There's always gonna be Pete right?

232
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,120
Scott: It's like in a small company like mine.

233
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:59,406
Scott: I don't think there's any people at my company who have any Disagreements on yeah.

234
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:03,140
Rym: All right, like you don't hire someone who disagrees with your business model, right?

235
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,580
Scott: But when your company is massive, you're gonna have all kinds of people right that what that you know.

236
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,015
Scott: The the what's it called guy worked at Google right the whole.

237
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:12,799
Scott: what was his name?

238
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:20,688
Scott: That could be any number of people now the whole the guy who wrote the sexist thing Oh, yeah, and all the Google people fought each other.

239
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,030
Scott: Yep.

240
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,715
Scott: It's like they were all Google employees.

241
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,220
Scott: It's just so big, right?

242
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:29,560
Scott: It's like if I even if I was the CEO of Google I couldn't personally screen everyone to make sure they weren't a piece of shit.

243
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:35,030
Scott: This is the second time My only job and I wouldn't even get to it that this happened to Google?

244
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:42,250
Rym: because a couple months ago a bunch of good A bunch of other Google employees working on project Maven.

245
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:50,297
Rym: Mm-hmm and Maven was the project to make AI for drone kill bots Yep, and Google employees were like, yeah, we'll quit.

246
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:51,020
Rym: This is fucked.

247
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:56,920
Rym: We do not want to do this and as best I can tell Google actually is Letting the contract with the Pentagon.

248
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,100
Rym: I think was the Pentagon with the US government run out and they're not going to continue the project.

249
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:08,574
Rym: tons of employees threatened to quit Practitioned so these two stories is the only thing right?

250
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,036
Scott: Is that like?

251
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:13,174
Scott: threatening to quit is good Especially if you're a valuable employee who's they really really need?

252
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:14,800
Rym: there's a subtle point there I think.

253
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:19,980
Rym: a big part of why or if you have enough employees that you can threaten to quit a big part of why?

254
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:26,852
Rym: I think Google employees in particular and this is just a pig In both these instances are willing.

255
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:39,456
Rym: it's not just they have a ton of money It's that people with these sets of skills are in desperate demand right now Across industries, but these people can all snap their fingers and work for any other company.

256
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:44,393
Scott: in this I think a better Thing to do than quit though, right sabotage.

257
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:46,200
Scott: Why did you figure me out?

258
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,185
Scott: Is that?

259
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:52,834
Scott: some people say oh you should stay and that way you still.

260
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:55,944
Scott: you're still in the system and you can still work to Make things better.

261
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:59,260
Scott: Well, there's some people say quit you shouldn't be working for an evil system.

262
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:01,669
Scott: I say stay in the system and sabotage.

263
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,420
Rym: Well, wasn't that the plot of Rogue One?

264
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,284
Scott: Yes, I mean, yeah There is a.

265
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,919
Rym: I would say there is a time and a place for that.

266
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,860
Rym: Neither one of these stories are at the line where I would directly advocate sabotage.

267
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:21,058
Scott: No, if they but if they had actually launched the Chinese Google, yeah, and then that's the first I heard.

268
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:25,571
Rym: so Why am I the real like awesome thing?

269
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:34,380
Rym: if Google were the company it was 15 years ago The awesome thing to do would be to have the secret project launch their sensor search engine in China.

270
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:43,935
Rym: Get adopt like make it the biggest search engine in China and then three years down the line Open the goddamn floodgates and spill the beans on everything inside China.

271
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:45,079
Scott: China just turn the site off.

272
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:54,300
Rym: Yeah But they could get the data out pretty quick like set it up such that they could blow their load and leak information All over China.

273
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,240
Scott: I think what's more likely what they would do is if they had managed to secretly develop this.

274
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:07,023
Scott: yeah, they would put it out in China and know and brand it and put it on infrastructure as such that nobody would know Google Had made it.

275
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:08,712
Rym: Yeah, I don't know the brand.

276
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,979
Scott: Google would be called something else.

277
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,499
Scott: It would just be a suspiciously good Chinese search engine.

278
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:25,300
Rym: But if you work in technology and a lot of the people listen to Monday gig nights, too my only advice to you is if your company is doing something that is unethical and It's a beyond a certain line of unethical

279
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:26,883
Scott: You

280
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:29,760
Rym: have a responsibility to not do the thing, right?

281
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,831
Scott: Even though you know whistleblowing is technically supposed to have protections But in reality you're gonna take a huge personal reality.

282
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,479
Scott: if you blow the whistle on things that are big enough You just get fucked but I'll fucking do it.

283
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,100
Rym: Anyway, yep, like if your company's doing stuff with ice, you should make a big deal about that and threaten to quit.

284
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:55,800
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

285
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,047
Rym: So a long time ago.

286
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:59,480
Rym: I did a thing of the day about this marble machine.

287
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,780
Rym: You've seen it around the internet like Rym's paying big attention to this.

288
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,217
Rym: Yeah cuz I've been following this guy.

289
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:09,997
Rym: so The marble machine was this amazing YouTube video and it was made by this dude who has this band called winter gotten.

290
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,465
Rym: and they do Like cool concerts and everything.

291
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:15,012
Scott: a winter got and not winter garden not winter garden.

292
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:15,955
Rym: winter got on.

293
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,757
Scott: Oh winter garden is a theater yeah, so winter gotten.

294
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:28,814
Rym: and Basically, the dude has been Continuously making YouTube videos every week for a long time.

295
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,038
Scott: I probably made a bunch of money from them.

296
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,122
Rym: Yeah on He's made.

297
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:38,760
Rym: basically the problem with that original marble machine as amazing as that video was is that it was basically a glass cannon.

298
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:43,720
Rym: That thing could run once and it barely ran.

299
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,487
Rym: Like it is so cobbled together.

300
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,871
Rym: It couldn't go on tour.

301
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:51,380
Rym: It's in a museum now and it's retired like it can't be used again.

302
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:56,631
Rym: I'm sure you could reset it with enough effort, but it wouldn't be easy Yeah, and it's hard to make it go and he can't travel with it.

303
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:08,805
Rym: So his goal was to Learn all the skills necessary to make a new marble machine that is robust and can go in a world tour Mm-hmm, and he's been like.

304
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:15,140
Rym: I've watched videos in this channel where he like learned how to weld from scratch and then welded.

305
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:19,835
Rym: He learned CNC he learned 3d printing he learned modeling.

306
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,580
Rym: and if you watch all these videos.

307
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:37,360
Rym: they're so meditative and so fascinating and Now is a good time to start watching them because the machines starting to come together And unlike a lot of the series where you might watch like someone building a machine Usually those series are retrospective on something that already succeeded.

308
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:39,933
Rym: We don't actually know if this will work.

309
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:41,420
Scott: It's gonna work eventually.

310
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,812
Scott: He's not gonna stop until it works as he's making them.

311
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,280
Scott: someone who's this determined is gonna keep going until it works.

312
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,446
Scott: Yeah, it will happen.

313
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:48,868
Scott: Eventually.

314
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:52,127
Scott: It's just a matter of when will it be this year next year Also some of the videos.

315
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,079
Rym: he fails like he fucks up.

316
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,980
Scott: Yeah That's what happens when you work on something.

317
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,004
Scott: Sometimes you fuck the fuck

318
00:21:57,105 --> 00:22:07,372
Rym: up and he learned stuff along the way and if you watch them like you could learn these same skills Because he goes from nothing and he asks people and looks on the internet and like oh This is how you weld and now I'll try to weld and that was a really.

319
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:12,960
Scott: just go on YouTube Yeah, or go to welding school, which is probably a better idea.

320
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:14,746
Rym: So this is so.

321
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:22,406
Rym: I'm linking to this because this is the video where he makes the flywheel and it's it's Really?

322
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,458
Rym: I like flywheels like it All right.

323
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,084
Rym: I Specifically like flywheels.

324
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:32,630
Rym: the very end he holds the clock up and he gets the flywheel spinning and he sees how long it'll spin a long time.

325
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:37,560
Rym: When this has a world tour, it's definitely coming to New York and I'm actually keeping my eye out.

326
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,592
Scott: I'm Number one fan.

327
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:41,614
Scott: You're gonna get his autograph.

328
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:43,978
Rym: He's got over a million subscribers.

329
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:44,599
Rym: He's pretty big.

330
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:45,420
Rym: now kiss his foot.

331
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,940
Rym: Yeah, I'm a big fan of this guy and I will go see this in concert.

332
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,860
Rym: Anyway, so what's your thing of the day?

333
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,980
Scott: So last week I had a thing of the day where it was like some jousting on the front of boats.

334
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:59,575
Rym: Everyone I have showed that video to three seconds in goes.

335
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:00,840
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's real good.

336
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:06,538
Scott: Here is in Germany a place where they I guess they do play some ice hockey in Germany, but not much.

337
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,216
Scott: Yeah So they have ice rinks in Germany, but in Germany they play soccer.

338
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,020
Scott: That's their sport.

339
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,034
Scott: Yeah, they didn't do too well this World Cup, but they usually do much better.

340
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:16,240
Scott: They're pretty good at soccer.

341
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:28,268
Scott: I think I read somewhere that like if you can't if you add up all the soccer leagues in Germany I think was it isn't called like the Bundesliga or something that there's like Thousands of soccer teams all in these leagues.

342
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:28,609
Scott: who it?

343
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:34,306
Scott: I get they have more soccer teams like than God anyway And that's just in Germany.

344
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:41,120
Scott: Oh, yeah, but here is people playing, you know I mean, they don't play ice hockey, but here they are with with an ice rink.

345
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,930
Rym: Well, a lot of fans will describe soccer as slow grass hockey.

346
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,380
Scott: Yeah, but here they are playing foot soccer.

347
00:23:50,181 --> 00:24:01,960
Rym: Yeah, and it's awesome, yeah, it's awesome because it is based on watching this video as dangerous as you could imagine Ice hockey is as dangerous as you can imagine.

348
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:10,705
Scott: This looks more dangerous than the only reason ice hockey looks less dangerous is because the people doing it are professionals who practiced not Stabbing each other with skates.

349
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:15,768
Scott: Yeah, also to imagine if a bunch of chumps go out and tried to play ice hockey You didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

350
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,480
Scott: There would be blood on the ice very quickly.

351
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:27,880
Rym: This basically has all the ridiculousness of ice hockey But what it does not have is the grace of ice hockey because ice hockey is a clever balance of brutality and grace.

352
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:34,723
Rym: This is just the brutality and people falling over over and over and over again Mostly the second part.

353
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,350
Rym: Yeah, but also this short clips got linked to.

354
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:39,858
Rym: I mean your thing today is basically an animated gif.

355
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,686
Scott: Yeah But I couldn't find.

356
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:45,747
Scott: I mean sure I'm sure if you knew what to search for you could find a full video But this is all spoilers.

357
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,415
Rym: They score a goal and someone falls over.

358
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,320
Scott: This is all I could find.

359
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,149
Scott: Yeah in the meta moment with my minimal effort.

360
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,240
Rym: The new GeekNights book club is going to be the Odyssey.

361
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,385
Scott: That's another Odyssey.

362
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:57,328
Scott: we'll do all Odyssey.

363
00:24:57,348 --> 00:25:02,553
Scott: the Space Odyssey went from the Greek Odyssey to the Space Odyssey lots and lots of Odyssey's.

364
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:09,258
Scott: so just yesterday I went to the theater to see 2001 a Space Odyssey in 70 millimeter.

365
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:09,740
Scott: How was that?

366
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,679
Scott: I hadn't seen it.

367
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,669
Scott: But first of all, we went to get a rep us.

368
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,960
Scott: then we walked over to the theater and it was fucking crowded.

369
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,970
Scott: I couldn't even believe it's been playing all week and like it wasn't 100% full, but it was very full.

370
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,222
Scott: Yeah, nothing looks as good as I mean no no.

371
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:26,290
Scott: current HD screen of digital.

372
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:35,028
Scott: This is as good as 70 millimeter film because the film is enormous And also, you know the acoustics of that particular theater insane.

373
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:37,440
Scott: so it was very loud.

374
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:47,370
Scott: like when the when the when the When the monolith goes when they're on the moon like everyone puts their finger in there Just like the astronauts because it was so fucking loud.

375
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:49,701
Rym: I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

376
00:25:49,721 --> 00:26:00,576
Scott: I hadn't seen it in a long time, but I saw it again and knowing what I know I've been learning more and more about it recently because I read like the first forward and the chap first I guess I should buy a Kindle copy of the book.

377
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,704
Scott: Yeah, I think a paper versions actually a few cents cheaper.

378
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:15,889
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, but So I didn't realize right that this movie was actually made in the mid 60s And it came out in 68 before anyone landed on the moon.

379
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,541
Scott: Right, I can't.

380
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:23,699
Scott: before Star Wars and I'm sure I mean, it's not I can't really spoil.

381
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,646
Scott: I mean, I've seen the movie.

382
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:26,630
Scott: It's not spoilers, right?

383
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,795
Scott: There's no way you can spoil something.

384
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:31,090
Scott: the the the statute of limitations is far gone.

385
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,386
Rym: Odysseus makes it home and murders all the suitors, right?

386
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:49,193
Scott: Yeah But yeah, the ending of the movie is obviously very Evangelion esque, but I cannot think of anything older that has that kind of psychedelic messed up non concrete ending Maybe.

387
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,650
Rym: maybe like some Stanislaus lamb short story might or something.

388
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,510
Rym: I mean short stories maybe but like not movies or TV or anything like yours that not like a full like a movie.

389
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,694
Scott: So it makes me wonder.

390
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:01,600
Scott: we'll talk about this more in the book club episode.

391
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:04,209
Scott: Is this the original terrible secret of space?

392
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,784
Scott: Maybe if you know any older Previous terrible secrets of space.

393
00:27:11,106 --> 00:27:11,530
Scott: Let me know.

394
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,375
Rym: Otherwise, we are going to be live.

395
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:19,810
Rym: the PAX West schedule just went up and the PAX website went down like immediately.

396
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,925
Rym: So we will be there all weekend like the whole con just doing stuff playing games.

397
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:27,550
Rym: We will not be a PAX dev this year.

398
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,133
Rym: We're skipping it.

399
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:29,016
Rym: I want to go.

400
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:30,463
Scott: Ben Brode is doing the keynote.

401
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:31,246
Scott: It's gonna be a good one.

402
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:32,050
Scott: I really want.

403
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:40,156
Scott: I read a preview of his keynote where he asked a basic interview with him asking about the stuff He's gonna talk about and it seemed way good.

404
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:46,122
Rym: Yep, but sometimes they put the keynotes from dev online So they're not privileged.

405
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:46,688
Scott: I've never seen one.

406
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:52,110
Rym: It depends some panels at PAX dev that people who run them agree that it can be made public.

407
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,490
Scott: I don't think he's gonna reveal any secrets or anything.

408
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,012
Rym: Probably not.

409
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:57,062
Scott: doesn't seem like he's gonna talk about that kind of stuff.

410
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:58,026
Scott: So we'll see.

411
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:58,790
Rym: it is public.

412
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:05,229
Rym: I will definitely make it a thing of the day Yeah, or I'll just link to it as a news whatever little show on it if it's real good.

413
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:08,663
Rym: But on Monday at 10 a.m.

414
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:09,387
Rym: We will be 10 a.m.

415
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:10,873
Rym: Pacific time.

416
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:23,504
Rym: our panel the 40 table-to-top games you must be labor day, you know It's labor day will be live streamed on either pecs 2 or pecs 3 one of the two Non-main theater pecs twitch streams.

417
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:29,030
Rym: Mm-hmm We will probably not take questions in the audience meaning we'll definitely not take questions from the twitch stream.

418
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,763
Scott: I was the twitch stream good guy.

419
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:37,690
Rym: I Used to take questions from the twitch stream on behalf of like for the panels back when I did that.

420
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,353
Scott: I want to answer.

421
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:42,829
Scott: if you want to ask questions while twitch streaming wait for me to just twitch stream something on my own.

422
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:50,147
Rym: Well, you know what I did for that is I let all the stupid questions fly by and I only took the one that was Good, I mean even so yeah.

423
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:54,445
Rym: Otherwise, yeah that the next kind we get after that is like PAX Unplugged.

424
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:58,522
Rym: and then Magfest which we will be at pretty sure.

425
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:06,890
Scott: magfest is going to announce its dates Imminently, so if you want to go to magfest magfest has traditionally been around New Year's.

426
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:14,530
Scott: Yeah, it's not hard to guess the dates of magfest if you were to bet on them Vegas would not take your money because the odds of you being right are so good.

427
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,383
Scott: It's gonna be within - it's gonna be a Thursday through a Sunday.

428
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,230
Scott: It's gonna be early in January.

429
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,779
Rym: It's gonna be between.

430
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,330
Scott: they got like three weekends to choose.

431
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:30,020
Rym: It'll be at earliest the very end of December and at latest Probably like the first weekend in February.

432
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,570
Scott: like that is the way we never go to February.

433
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:37,630
Scott: So gonna be January and and even late January's a crack is unlikely.

434
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,550
Rym: So they're probably gonna announce it real soon.

435
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:47,521
Rym: So if you want to go to magfest jump on that because they do sell out of badges now And they might well, they need to sell out of hotel rooms now.

436
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,410
Rym: Well, they definitely sell out of hotel rooms.

437
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,810
Scott: You're gonna have to stay in a hotel far away and take a shitty shuttle all the way.

438
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,679
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna suck which is a 24/7 con.

439
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:59,269
Scott: You know, I think they just announced the dates really just now.

440
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:04,986
Rym: Pat just pointed out that they just announced the dates like just this second while recording the podcast.

441
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:06,330
Rym: gonna find out I'm going to their Twitter.

442
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,729
Scott: Magfest the time on the tweet.

443
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:11,315
Rym: Let's see man.

444
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:13,188
Rym: three hours ago.

445
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:16,141
Rym: Magfest is January 3rd through 6.

446
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:16,683
Scott: Oh shit.

447
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,350
Scott: Looks like I bet wisely.

448
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:22,045
Rym: Yes, if you do not have a total hotel for magfest go get one.

449
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,480
Scott: right now You're not watching the stream, which you shouldn't be.

450
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,909
Rym: if you're watching the stream go there right now.

451
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,501
Scott: The rest of the stream it's not gonna be.

452
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:37,766
Rym: retweet this right now Because they don't sell out as fast as PAX East, but they sell out.

453
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:38,107
Rym: Mm-hmm.

454
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:45,776
Rym: So a long long time ago August 7th 2007 okay.

455
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:51,445
Rym: We did a GeekNights episode 11 years ago on FPS key bindings.

456
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:51,949
Scott: Mm-hmm.

457
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:58,826
Scott: Oh, we probably talked about how uses weird shit in the bottom right area because so the way he played doom or whatever.

458
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:09,190
Rym: in the news of that episode We announced that like valve was releasing 24 old games on Steam and we're really excited about it.

459
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:12,219
Rym: And Best Buy did.

460
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,863
Rym: what is Best Buy?

461
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,310
Rym: do Best Buy?

462
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:17,650
Rym: Oh that does not link to the article.

463
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:18,795
Rym: So, I don't know.

464
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,750
Rym: Best Buy did something and there's literally no way to know what it was.

465
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,123
Scott: All right, we can listen to the episode.

466
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:29,550
Rym: Yeah And in January 21st 2008 we did an episode on keyboards.

467
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:31,132
Rym: But what?

468
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:37,230
Rym: we have never talked about our keyboard shortcuts and we realized we actually have a lot to say about keyboard shortcuts.

469
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:37,471
Rym: Yeah,

470
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:46,821
Scott: well, I mean the thing with keyboard shortcuts right is like there's sort of this thing that's like People who could use them to greatly improve their computing efficiency

471
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:48,405
Rym: seem to refuse to don't

472
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:55,559
Scott: or whatever and then also simultaneous to that There's a lot of people more and more who can't write.

473
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,790
Scott: young people don't even use a keyboard computer with a keyboard anymore.

474
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,741
Scott: They got a phone or a tablet or a gaming console or whatever.

475
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:04,150
Rym: There aren't keyboard shortcuts on tablets, right?

476
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,210
Rym: There are gestures, but I find that most people don't use gestures either.

477
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,983
Scott: It's weird cuz like as a PC person you think all these kids playing Fortnite.

478
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:15,723
Scott: you imagine them sitting at their computers like no They're not Fortnite on their phone or on their ps4.

479
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:16,286
Scott: Who knows what.

480
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:17,452
Rym: I'm gonna try it out You know what?

481
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:18,622
Rym: I'm gonna play it on my switch.

482
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:19,529
Scott: Yeah, I'm not playing it.

483
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:22,437
Rym: But yeah, probably more up your alley than G.

484
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:28,950
Scott: young people do not use keyboards at all Really, and even if they do not a lot of them can type properly.

485
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,688
Scott: Yeah, there's only the ones who got into PC gaming.

486
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:32,030
Scott: somehow.

487
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,830
Scott: Usually the ones who don't live in America is be more likely to be when we say properly.

488
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:39,139
Rym: I don't even care if you type like the proper proper way.

489
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:39,841
Rym: It's just.

490
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:40,823
Rym: can you type fast?

491
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,488
Scott: Yep without looking.

492
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,221
Rym: Yep While these kids are pretty fast on their phones They cannot type as fast as me on a keyboard.

493
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,070
Scott: also old people, right?

494
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,023
Scott: some of them can type especially if they were even if they were typewriter people.

495
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,107
Scott: right and they.

496
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:57,717
Scott: but they Don't use keyboard shortcuts.

497
00:32:57,797 --> 00:33:01,590
Scott: Like they're not you know, I is they do, you know only the ones who would be like eunuch Santas.

498
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,579
Scott: Those are the only kind of old people who'd use keyboard truck.

499
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,810
Rym: There's another kind of old person use keyboard shortcuts.

500
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:14,210
Rym: These are the people who are very good at the most basic nonsense on computers And I say very good making air quotes.

501
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:20,570
Rym: The kind of person whose job is to mess with Excel spreadsheets and type documents in Word.

502
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,900
Scott: Even those people are very mousy.

503
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:30,650
Rym: those people are very mousy But I've noticed that a lot of them tend to be told a set of keyboard shortcuts that they memorize.

504
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:35,330
Rym: And if those keyboard shortcuts ever change or don't work, I think they are fucking paralyzed.

505
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:37,344
Scott: I think people know ctrl C ctrl V.

506
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:41,925
Rym: Yeah But they'll learn like ctrl I are or like.

507
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:48,290
Rym: they'll know a thing to like In like a test like inserting a row in a spreadsheet like some bullshit like that

508
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:48,914
Scott: Anyway,

509
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:57,910
Rym: and they won't know how to do the thing Unless the exact menu that they were taught is still there or the keyboard shortcut that someone told them still works.

510
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,397
Scott: So the people use keyboard shortcuts a lot.

511
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,764
Scott: is this narrow group of people?

512
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:28,688
Scott: actually even it's not it's still a large group But percentage wise it's a small group of people who a are in an age where they use computers of keyboards often They can type properly or well it well enough and also are computer savvy enough and interested in computing efficiency enough that they bother to learn and Muscle memorize shortcuts so that they don't have to touch the mouse and they could do computing things faster.

513
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:28,889
Rym: now.

514
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:38,989
Rym: I think most of the people who do this are Honestly Professional the kind of person who needs a PC to be a workstation like artists who are making arts.

515
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,357
Scott: Yeah, Photoshop people.

516
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,723
Scott: They know all these crazy shortcuts and Programmers they know whatever their text editor is.

517
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:56,900
Rym: they know mad shortcuts Yep, but what's interesting is that for a lot of those use cases like especially like video a heavy video editing a lot of times people have Specialty input devices like.

518
00:34:56,981 --> 00:35:05,850
Rym: I have my shuttle that I use when I edit video But all that shuttle is doing while it has like the shuttle and the like all the like fancy dial type things.

519
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:11,327
Rym: The rest of it is just a bunch of keyboard buttons that I've bound to do.

520
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:14,125
Scott: keyboard shortcuts I mean pretty much everything's just a cube, right?

521
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,710
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so the the thing with keyboard shortcuts, right?

522
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,255
Scott: Is that they increase?

523
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:23,010
Scott: you don't even realize how much they increase your computing efficiency.

524
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,773
Scott: Yeah, right.

525
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,739
Scott: if you want to have a race, right.

526
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:29,913
Scott: and it's like okay accomplish pretty much pick any computing task Right.

527
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:34,570
Scott: and it's someone who actually knows how to use keyboard shortcuts and someone who has to use the mouse all the time.

528
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:39,769
Scott: The mouse person is going to lose pretty much everything all the time.

529
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:44,245
Scott: Keyboards are just faster Just about everything.

530
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:50,470
Scott: So I guess The keyboard shortcut I probably use the most is ctrl L. why cuz you're in a browser the most?

531
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:57,501
Scott: So the key word shortcuts in the browser this this three that I use more than anything control L Highlights all the text in the location bars.

532
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,389
Scott: you press ctrl L and start typing URL.

533
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:05,150
Scott: Yeah, you really think you're gonna beat me by going up to with the mouse to the location bar and like clicking on it.

534
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:13,376
Scott: I've already typed the URL and press enter Even if you can type as fast as me if you don't press ctrl L and you click there instead You've already lost right?

535
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:20,701
Rym: So the keyboard shortcuts I use more than anything are ctrl Z Undo and ctrl Y though can redo.

536
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:27,999
Rym: redo though actually in a lot of Adobe software redo Will only work once or undo will only work once it depends.

537
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,130
Rym: You'll have like a separate like ctrl shift Z to step backward.

538
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:38,658
Rym: Yeah, yeah But again already that's getting into professional Expert use cases and specialized.

539
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:39,620
Scott: I'm at the browser right.

540
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,887
Scott: the thing that everyone's using on a computer the browser.

541
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:45,137
Scott: ctrl T for a new Tab ctrl W to close the current tab.

542
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:49,289
Rym: control shift T is fucking wizardry to the shocking number of control.

543
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,739
Scott: shift T open the last tab that got closed.

544
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:52,100
Scott: Yep.

545
00:36:52,220 --> 00:37:04,179
Rym: You guys realize if you close a browser window And have another browser window open and in ctrl shift T It'll reopen that browser window and you keep hitting ctrl shift T. It keeps opening old tabs.

546
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,147
Scott: you had net that you closed in the order.

547
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:06,710
Scott: you closed them.

548
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,909
Scott: Yep, you can do ctrl N for a new window.

549
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:12,118
Scott: You could do all right and alt.

550
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:14,885
Scott: left will go forward and back but backspace is also back.

551
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,550
Scott: backspace is a really convenient back button.

552
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:21,357
Rym: I Was that the hill I will die on and UX.

553
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:26,150
Rym: the backspace key should never have done anything in a web browser ever.

554
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,258
Rym: Well, it does other than backspace a character.

555
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:39,167
Rym: That was the most bullshit UX design decision Anyone has ever made other than making the stairs Steeper on the eighth floor of my building and the shortcuts within Chrome Firefox, whatever.

556
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,090
Scott: It's all slightly different.

557
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:45,060
Scott: But yeah, like ctrl L works in just about every browser There's three categories of keyboard shortcuts.

558
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,426
Rym: like really put a fine point on this.

559
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:53,589
Scott: there's the Completely generic effectively universal control s saves on every piece of a software ever.

560
00:37:53,789 --> 00:38:00,845
Rym: Yep there's the ones that are common to the applications that normal people use regularly like web browsers.

561
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:10,532
Rym: and then there's the Specialized shortcuts for professional workflows, which is actually the most interesting use case that really only professionals do and like normal people seem to be Incapable of.

562
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:15,330
Rym: so like it's interesting watching people fumble through like Adobe software.

563
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:24,169
Rym: Like when I first started learning how to edit video I would do everything with the keyboard because I didn't really know the best way to approach my task Like what kind of insert do I want to do?

564
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:33,690
Rym: So the fact that there is a visual UI is very good for tasks They're new to you or tasks that are not commonly done by you.

565
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,997
Scott: Well, also it's very convenient.

566
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:40,330
Scott: you hover your mouse over an icon and it shows you Oh, you know, you could press this key instead of pressing this button with the mouse.

567
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,984
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you go into a menu to be like your file menu and it just.

568
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:48,764
Scott: all the shortcuts are listed in the Menu, so now you can learn if you keep clicking on the same menu option.

569
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,210
Scott: It's like oh, there's a shortcut for this.

570
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,435
Scott: I'm not gonna go up here anymore.

571
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:55,150
Scott: And there's always that one really disappointing menu option that has no text next to it.

572
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:01,909
Rym: Yep, it's like well, I guess I have to go to the menu for this but it's good because it allows discovery like it allows the person to learn the interface.

573
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:07,634
Rym: and Frankly while there are like Adobe Audition and Premiere are good examples There are.

574
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,486
Rym: I could literally bind keys to do goddamn anything.

575
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:20,676
Rym: I can bind Macros look like I'm macros later and like really complex stuff, but the reality is Most super complex workflows.

576
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:24,870
Rym: I don't do often or maybe I'll do once in the course of a project.

577
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:27,258
Rym: I don't need a dedicated button there.

578
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,706
Scott: I think it's very rare that you need anything.

579
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,010
Scott: That's not the default, right?

580
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:36,490
Scott: It's like unless you're have a job where you've you know have some complicated thing and even have a complicated thing.

581
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:36,691
Scott: It's like.

582
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:40,890
Scott: you should probably just have a piece of software that does it not need to program a macro.

583
00:39:40,953 --> 00:39:51,446
Rym: Yeah well like for example I like my I have this shuttle device is basically just a keyboard with labels on it and some fancy controls and the key bindings I have are the things I do all the time and every project.

584
00:39:51,466 --> 00:40:05,422
Rym: things like insert video from the preview area into the sequence I'm working on or Like set an in-point or set an out point or remove an in-point or an out point like really odd basic stuff that otherwise I would be clicking constantly to do

585
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:06,670
Scott: or you could just use the keyboard.

586
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:16,749
Rym: Well because most of what I'm doing also is scrubbing and navigating back and forth through the timeline I can just scrub with the mouse wheel But I still use the keyboard for all the other buttons.

587
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:20,524
Rym: Mouse wheel scrubbing isn't frame by frame if you want to do certain things.

588
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:22,110
Scott: Mouse wheel is very very good.

589
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,929
Rym: It's not frame by frame on broken Mouse.

590
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:32,657
Scott: Also you hold down some various buttons in the keyboard to adjust the speed of the scroll or I just twist the shuttle and The further I twist it the faster.

591
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:35,350
Scott: I don't need to have some weird device for no reason.

592
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,919
Rym: Yeah, cuz you basically don't do any complicated video editor But the point is that you just like to buy fancy shit.

593
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,710
Scott: I have keyboard binding break shit to buy new shit fancy shit.

594
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,859
Scott: This was like $40 and you just like to buy nonsense stuff.

595
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,868
Rym: My keyboard costs way more than this thing.

596
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:50,289
Scott: mine, too.

597
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:56,698
Rym: But I also have keyboards but basically the things that I do semi commonly.

598
00:40:56,718 --> 00:41:06,110
Rym: I do have keyboard bindings too, but these are all like professional use cases and When I want to undo I still just hit ctrl Z. why wouldn't you on my tablet?

599
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,920
Rym: I hit the top left button is undo.

600
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,919
Rym: in the top the bottom left button is redo Because I draw something and it's wrong and I undo.

601
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:14,903
Rym: draw it again wrong.

602
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:15,906
Rym: draw it again wrong.

603
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:16,469
Rym: draw it again now.

604
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:27,249
Scott: It's good Yeah, so one thing that I do right is is in most keyboard shortcuts in you know Cuz you press keys in the keyboard and unless you have a piece of software like vim I think vim is the only one that's modal.

605
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:40,270
Scott: Yeah, right the most of the buttons on the keyboard have a automatic function like you press L. It types the letter L. Yeah, you always need to combine it with alt or control or window key or something You know to to have a shortcut happen, right?

606
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:48,479
Scott: and what really shocks me to this day is they still make keyboards where the Easiest button to hit that doesn't do anything is caps lock.

607
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,522
Scott: Yeah, right.

608
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:52,610
Scott: I always change caps lock into control with the defaults.

609
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:59,630
Rym: Why are you changing from a default as Scott spent like 20 minutes telling me you should never customize anything?

610
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,610
Scott: I don't because what I do is I just buy a keyboard where the keyboard has a control there instead of a cap.

611
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:10,459
Scott: So rather than just making a simple software change to remap So it's actually not a simple software change fucking.

612
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,696
Scott: if you in Windows if you want to change caps lock into control Edit the goddamn registry, mr.

613
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:19,506
Rym: Fancy pants needs his custom fucking keyboard to move.

614
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,930
Scott: how often you use caps lock?

615
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,462
Rym: More often than you would.

616
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:25,449
Scott: why are you using caps?

617
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,573
Scott: What's wrong with you?

618
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:30,170
Rym: for this for the dumbest possible reason right?

619
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,281
Scott: The reason is troll is a button you're hitting all around.

620
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:33,703
Rym: it is.

621
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:40,390
Rym: I work in Finance and I am typing ticker names into case sensitive systems.

622
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,819
Scott: Sometimes also, I'm way bad at typing.

623
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:43,702
Scott: I never use right shift.

624
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,006
Scott: I use left shift all the time.

625
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,275
Rym: I Shifts equally.

626
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,123
Scott: I never use the right shift shift.

627
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:49,806
Scott: I probably never.

628
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:50,810
Rym: I use right.

629
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:54,870
Rym: I use left shift way more often than right shift, but I probably have never pressed the right shift.

630
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:56,295
Scott: I always.

631
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:58,970
Scott: I think it's a completely unused button on my keyboard.

632
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:01,205
Scott: You might like if you look at the number of times been pressed.

633
00:43:01,265 --> 00:43:01,990
Scott: It might be zero.

634
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:05,110
Rym: Uh, I think I've hit pause fewer times than I've hit right.

635
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,452
Scott: Maybe I should like consciously try to start using the right shift key to capitalize letters on the left side of the keyboard like It's supposed to.

636
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:13,220
Rym: yeah, pause and scroll lock.

637
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:14,886
Scott: The point is caps lock is useless.

638
00:43:15,127 --> 00:43:15,468
Scott: You should.

639
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:19,184
Scott: if you're on a Mac It's actually way easy to turns caps lock into control or command.

640
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:28,770
Scott: and that brings me to something else Which on Windows you've got control and you go window key, but window key is used for like lock the computer with window L. Yeah, you don't really use it in a piece of software, right?

641
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:35,730
Scott: So you got control use control for and all is to usually to go into the menu or to type funny characters and Unicode.

642
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:45,110
Rym: So what's fun is in all the professional software I have you basically can make any combination of control alt shift All is y'all a lot of times used with control.

643
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:48,365
Scott: But usually you're gonna combine control and shift before you combine control and all.

644
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,470
Scott: all is like the last one.

645
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:55,030
Scott: And but on Mac they give you command and option and all are the same thing base, right?

646
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:00,756
Scott: But they give you command in addition to control and it really sucks on a Mac Even though you get used to it eventually.

647
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:16,822
Scott: is that in Mac apps like if you're in their browser, it's not control T It's command T. It's not control W. It's command W. It's like, okay I'll just replace control with command right but then you open up say a terminal on a Mac and in bash Right that you want to go to the end of the line with.

648
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:18,833
Scott: you know control E. Well, guess what?

649
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:20,542
Scott: It's not command E is control E.

650
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:21,568
Rym: It's why I don't use a Mac.

651
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:27,670
Scott: Yeah Well, it's one reason right but it's like so when you're on a Mac I sort of have it in muscle memory now, even though I rarely use a man.

652
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:34,610
Scott: Yeah that you know in which apps command which apps are control, but it's like well What do you change caps lock into command or control?

653
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:46,269
Scott: Right because if you you know, it's like I change it into command use usually But that means anytime I open an app where I got to use control I got to move my finger way further and find this other weird-ass button.

654
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:49,569
Rym: You just use the defaults and just learn to live with them.

655
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:53,626
Scott: But that's I'm saying is that even if you didn't change caps like in anything on a Mac.

656
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:55,734
Scott: Yeah in a browser You're gonna be pressing command.

657
00:44:55,774 --> 00:44:57,219
Scott: It's kind of amazing in a terminal.

658
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,162
Scott: You can be pressing control.

659
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:07,350
Rym: It's both sad and amazing to me that Windows and Mac diverged on this sort of fundamental thing and Stayed that way forever, right?

660
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:18,689
Rym: And while Mac had the open Apple button, which they got rid of and then Windows added the Windows key so I would argue that way more people use PCs and way more people like were used to the windows the way of doing things.

661
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:26,968
Rym: and meanwhile Mac Early days probably had a vested interest in keeping it weird because once someone was used to a Mac You didn't want it to be easy for them to go back to a PC.

662
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:30,867
Rym: You want them to try to use a PC get annoyed by it and stay in Mac land forever.

663
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,310
Scott: Mm-hmm Well, that's the thing.

664
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:37,970
Scott: So few people use keyboard shortcuts that this is no longer a thing that people are annoyed by keeping them in one zone or the other.

665
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:45,947
Rym: Yeah Now one thing that's really sad that I see a lot among older people is that older people really seem to love macros.

666
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:48,596
Scott: I Don't know about this.

667
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:50,910
Rym: I see the business analysts tend to do this all the time.

668
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:51,694
Rym: They they will.

669
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:53,403
Rym: they will literally like forget.

670
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:56,755
Rym: I'm not talking about Excel Keyboard shortcut problem.

671
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:57,879
Scott: that sounds just like a hammer.

672
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,285
Scott: have a hammer everything.

673
00:45:59,345 --> 00:46:00,530
Scott: It looks like nails problem.

674
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,783
Rym: So people will make complex macros sometimes with custom software though.

675
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:05,104
Scott: Luckily.

676
00:46:05,144 --> 00:46:07,090
Scott: This is the only kind of programming they know how to do.

677
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,857
Rym: This did seem to be a dying thing But it seems like it's coming back.

678
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:25,221
Rym: a lot of gamers will use software to bind Macros to their mouse and keyboard buttons to do things in games when the game does not provide a single Button that you could bind to do that thing.

679
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:38,006
Rym: Mm-hmm and Gamers seem to be the only good use case for this but usually seem people seem to only use macros when they have a Repetitive task and they don't know how to script or automate it.

680
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:45,110
Rym: So they Script or automate hitting a keyboard shortcut a bunch of times in a row things like that.

681
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,024
Rym: It's usually the wrong solution to a problem.

682
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:52,808
Scott: a lot of times in the office You're gonna hear someone like typing like chicken chicken chicken chicken.

683
00:46:52,828 --> 00:47:02,428
Scott: Oh my god They might be pricing like something like down control V down control V down control V down control V. It make like ten lines in turn like typing detected, right?

684
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:08,677
Scott: And it's like you can hear that and you can tell this person knows Enough that they can do it.

685
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:12,390
Scott: They've improved the efficiency a little bit, but they don't really know.

686
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,590
Scott: I could do this with literally like what pressing two keys?

687
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:18,440
Rym: It's like getting really good at chopping down a tree.

688
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,910
Rym: with an axe you're still not gonna be faster than a chainsaw.

689
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,960
Scott: Yeah, like you don't know a chainsaw exists.

690
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:24,568
Scott: See you master the axe.

691
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:32,714
Rym: Yep No, I get no again Like I have done that sometimes like if you just have like a thing and you want a really quick Like oh, I got it like space.

692
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:36,285
Scott: Yeah, sometimes it's faster to just control V five times.

693
00:47:36,345 --> 00:47:37,509
Scott: Yeah, sometimes it's not.

694
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:37,990
Scott: there's a lot.

695
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,929
Rym: Well, there's the line that you hear to chica chica chica chica chica chica chica.

696
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:44,687
Rym: If you hear one more after that someone's going about something the wrong way.

697
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:47,552
Rym: Yeah But it is.

698
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:57,920
Rym: it's weird how I see a lot of people not knowing these shortcuts but Simultaneously like especially browsers, especially control shift.

699
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,350
Scott: if nothing else you need to learn the basic keyword shortcuts of the browser.

700
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:08,350
Scott: You should be able to browse the web without ever touching the mouse except maybe to click on a link and even then it's not Necessary it's not necessary.

701
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:15,256
Scott: But there's some websites where you pretty much only pretty much I only click all I use the mouse for in a browser clicking on Nothing else anything else.

702
00:48:15,316 --> 00:48:17,644
Scott: I do the keyboard and that means I can browse.

703
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,510
Scott: that's how I can read so much internet so fast.

704
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:24,330
Scott: Part of it is I scroll with the keyboard or I search the page of the keyboard.

705
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,289
Scott: I go to different pages with the keyboard.

706
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,723
Rym: now what I don't do is I never like.

707
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:35,037
Rym: it's a complex software like Audition all these Adobe things like Photoshop type stuff.

708
00:48:35,939 --> 00:48:39,890
Rym: I never change what the keyboard shortcuts are.

709
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,190
Rym: I learn what the keyboard shortcuts are and just use them.

710
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:43,690
Scott: That's right.

711
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:48,452
Rym: And if I want if I want a key to do something special It's not.

712
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:56,075
Rym: it's never because I want to change the key binding to like insert from A to Q. It's always.

713
00:48:56,095 --> 00:49:18,930
Rym: I want to bind a key to something very complex like basically one step short of a macro or you want to bind a key to something that does not have a default binding because a lot of professional software will let you bind keys to things that does not have a default for Because by the time you even know that thing exists You're already a very advanced user and you're gonna like you're doing something weird or something custom.

714
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,690
Rym: There's a lot of things that don't have default binding.

715
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:31,507
Scott: Usually I feel like if you ever encounter a situation like you have to customize something that's probably a sign That like hey, this is not the way that everyone does.

716
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:34,744
Scott: this is you know Either a the thing we're trying to do is not a thing people do.

717
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:35,690
Scott: you shouldn't even be doing it.

718
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:43,200
Scott: It's probably something else you can do to accomplish your goal or be the way you are trying to accomplish Your goal is is actually some other way.

719
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:43,923
Scott: That's way better.

720
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:45,470
Scott: You just don't know it, right?

721
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,610
Rym: But like here's an example I could bind like there's all like there's a billion billion bindings in audition.

722
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,522
Rym: Only some of them are defaults and there's actually different sets of defaults.

723
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:59,063
Rym: Like you can set it to act like other software Yeah, which is a common thing.

724
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:02,290
Scott: Yeah, it's like okay We want to get people to use this software who are used to something.

725
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:05,730
Rym: I want Excel to act like Quattro Pro, which just set my age.

726
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,041
Scott: It's like I got used to Quattro Express or whatever.

727
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:11,389
Scott: It's like why I don't want to have to get used to Excel.

728
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:12,334
Scott: now It's like alright.

729
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:14,930
Scott: Well the Excel people added a feature so you can do that.

730
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,325
Scott: But yep, you should just get used to Excel instead.

731
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:18,130
Rym: I'm looking for an example.

732
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:25,338
Rym: Like there is a keyboard shortcut a default one for in audition Decrease brush opacity.

733
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,207
Scott: Mmm, isn't that for Photoshop?

734
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:34,507
Rym: Uh You realize you can draw on Waveforms and on spectrals and do things with them in audition, right?

735
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:39,704
Scott: Okay What is opacity translate to like amplitude or what?

736
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:41,170
Rym: it depends on what you're doing.

737
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:49,546
Rym: You can you can select with a degree of equivalent opacity Areas of a spectral display and then apply transformations to just that area.

738
00:50:49,566 --> 00:51:01,225
Rym: Yeah But there is no default binding to razor all clips Uh-huh, but you could just decide to bind a key that doesn't have a default selection to that.

739
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:08,737
Rym: if that's a thing you do commonly But normally that's a thing that someone who doesn't do that Commonly would click on something in the UI to do.

740
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:14,179
Scott: the point is is that the number of people who learn keyboard shortcuts use them Commonly and use them.

741
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:15,107
Scott: Well is not enough.

742
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,980
Scott: They the advantage of you if you mess.

743
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,114
Scott: if you get keyboard shortcuts for the applications You use the most into your muscle memory your computing experience will be Insanely improved.

744
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:33,550
Scott: you don't even realize it's like it's insane how much faster you will get shit done If you just learn the goddamn shortcuts and stop resisting.

745
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:39,090
Rym: So if you ever find yourself doing the same thing more than like three times in a row It's.

746
00:51:39,371 --> 00:51:48,012
Scott: it's possible to do everything on a computer no matter what with keyword only except interact with a flash website maybe Through.

747
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:51,183
Scott: I recommend if you can just unplug your mouse.

748
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:53,030
Scott: don't use any mice and try to see if you can.

749
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,476
Rym: Just that's a good so fun idea.

750
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:59,330
Scott: just browse try to browse the web and do your daily browsing without the mouse at all.

751
00:51:59,412 --> 00:52:00,069
Scott: Just unplug it.

752
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:05,318
Rym: This gave me an idea for a game that we could make a game show out of in live stream I mean, but I would I can browse the web.

753
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,086
Rym: Oh, no, no, we would be the arbiters.

754
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:07,910
Rym: We've got other people do it.

755
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:15,770
Rym: Mouseless horse, you know the game a horse in basketball Where you make a shot and then the other person has the exact same shot.

756
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,094
Scott: There's a game called vim horse.

757
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:18,017
Scott: It's probably older than you.

758
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:33,402
Rym: Yeah, so I'm saying we could apply this to For people who are not computer experts because it's way more fun that way you put them in front of a computer no applications are open and You give them increasingly complex tasks and they have to solve.

759
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:38,570
Rym: they have to do them without using a mouse And you see who fails first, right?

760
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,249
Scott: And obviously those people are gonna take forever.

761
00:52:40,772 --> 00:52:42,579
Scott: But if you're good at it, it would take you.

762
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:45,370
Scott: you can actually beat someone who's got a mouse easily.

763
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:47,228
Scott: Yep, if you knew them, so learn them.

764
