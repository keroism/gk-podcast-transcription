1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,297
Rym: It's Monday, December 14th, 2015.

2
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:12,219
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,961
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:16,409
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight the death of QA or not?

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,177
Scott: really Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:28,433
Rym: Scott witnessed me on the glory road as I died.

7
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:28,654
Rym: history.

8
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:31,227
Rym: Well, actually no, I did not die historic I just won the race.

9
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,320
Rym: Scott died historic in last place.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,380
Rym: Congratulations on winning the 50% random game the game that was a skill game until you lost.

11
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,908
Scott: It's a 50% random game 50% skill and 50% luck.

12
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:45,020
Scott: if you you can make poor decisions and lose it very easily.

13
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,379
Scott: You can also just be unlucky and lose.

14
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:52,859
Rym: Well, it's got a more complex push your luck in the sense that odds making matters a lot.

15
00:00:53,624 --> 00:01:00,960
Scott: And so in the second half of the final app I pushed it as hard as I could because that was my time to go but you were already behind because of poor decisions earlier.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,320
Scott: I didn't make a poor decision.

17
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:10,344
Rym: I held back and took the safest possible risks the entire time and then I had all the resources I needed to just floor it For the entire end of the race.

18
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:13,836
Scott: Listen, that's how things sometimes go in the world of racing.

19
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:14,920
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of cheating.

20
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,560
Rym: I mean I saw f1 on that course.

21
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,326
Rym: Yeah, you know what I knew.

22
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,911
Rym: you know what I knew from what I saw.

23
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:27,330
Rym: they slowed down a lot at the two corners And then they sped up again as fast as they could.

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,620
Scott: it's true for every race ever of cars.

25
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,146
Scott: That is true any kind.

26
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,752
Scott: when you have to turn you must slow.

27
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:42,260
Rym: the X part of that track is pretty cool Like the course in Singapore because it's basically an X with two pretty much 90 degree turns right at the same spot.

28
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:49,340
Rym: So like full out like there are hard turns, but there's also like some crazy long like where'd you cane like things on the other side?

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,800
Rym: But yeah, so playing some games over the weekend games are playing a lot more games now that it's cold and can't bike to wait.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,528
Rym: It's not cold.

31
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,195
Rym: It's spring.

32
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,677
Rym: Yesterday wasn't yesterday the hottest yesterday in New York City history.

33
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:04,179
Scott: I'll take it.

34
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,394
Rym: Yeah, if it would stay like this here, but isn't people all upset about global warming.

35
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:08,916
Scott: You know what?

36
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:09,960
Scott: I welcome it.

37
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,633
Scott: I mean, yeah, the world's gonna be destroyed or whatever.

38
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,336
Scott: It's gonna suck.

39
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,080
Scott: That sucks.

40
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:23,338
Scott: I don't like that but what I do like is at least none of that will happen in my lifetime and In my lifetime New York will become tropical hopefully or more tropical.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,108
Scott: Hey, I'll make my life way way better.

42
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,335
Rym: problem a lot of standing water and stuff in New York.

43
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,635
Rym: if it gets much more tropical Malaria might come here.

44
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:33,023
Scott: That's fine.

45
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:36,293
Rym: a New York with malaria is cannot a great place to be.

46
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,580
Rym: yellow fever get some cholera hanging out.

47
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:42,219
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna get malaria even if malaria comes to New York.

48
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,354
Rym: Malaria if malaria comes to New York, you'll probably get it.

49
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,805
Rym: because you bike around all the time You can't go to Rockaway anymore.

50
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:48,508
Scott: Why not?

51
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:56,154
Rym: That's where the mosquitoes are all gonna be by that a bobo bo bridge Alright, so then you'll get malaria and you automatically get it.

52
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:56,716
Rym: You'll get it.

53
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,160
Rym: mosquitoes bite you if you're hanging outside.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,794
Scott: I also just constantly take prevention medicines.

55
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:01,980
Rym: Yeah, those drugs suck.

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,560
Rym: There's a reason why when I travel despite the fact that I'm going to some malaria areas I don't take it and I just don't fucking go outside.

57
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:20,335
Scott: Well, listen Bill Gates is already putting mad money towards the malaria in Africa, you know, so if malaria starts spreading to the rest of the world Definitely people are gonna start putting a lot of money to fixing that shit real fast.

58
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:25,591
Scott: Yeah Also, wouldn't that be a crazy good sci-fi story?

59
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:30,170
Scott: if like, you know right now humans dominate the world But in some distant future.

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,164
Scott: malaria is like the number one species on earth Because it just kills everything.

61
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:39,300
Rym: Uh, I don't think malaria specifically would become the biggest species on earth.

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,555
Rym: It'd be more malaria than anything else, but it wouldn't have any places to live.

63
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:43,680
Rym: left mosquitoes.

64
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:45,205
Rym: But it needs all.

65
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,236
Rym: it doesn't just go from mosquito to mosquito.

66
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:47,900
Rym: They'd eat each other.

67
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,507
Rym: It goes mosquito to human to mosquito.

68
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,579
Rym: mosquitoes can't eat mosquitoes yet unless the ape learns to kill the ape.

69
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:58,942
Rym: so in actual news We talked about this a bit because it was coming for a long time but it actually happened.

70
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:11,439
Rym: the FAA regulations start in a week on drones if your drone weighs more if you're in the United States and your drone weighs more if you're in the United States and You have a drone that you can control.

71
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:17,298
Rym: So like model rockets don't count unless your model rocket has a guidance system that you control from the ground.

72
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,833
Rym: Then and it weighs more than 250 grams.

73
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:26,620
Rym: So point five pounds meaning every drone worth a damn.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,140
Rym: You must register it by law on an FAA website the same way you register for like a ham radio.

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,104
Scott: These are tests needed.

76
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:38,260
Rym: No, you have to register it as yours like serial number and everything.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,628
Rym: So if it does anything shady, they can come to your house and be like, yo, dude Oh, that's not too bad.

78
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:44,855
Scott: It's not even like a driver's license.

79
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:45,620
Scott: It's that's way easy.

80
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,793
Scott: Yeah, go to a website and fill it out and push submit and you're good.

81
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,020
Rym: It costs five dollars.

82
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:52,760
Scott: But oh, no, you can afford a drone, but you don't have five extra dollars.

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,970
Rym: But for the first month because this is new regulation registration is free.

84
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,782
Scott: Oh Even better.

85
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:06,664
Rym: you spent your last dollar on the drone and you're still good and you only have to register it before you fly It the first time.

86
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,900
Scott: so you keep your drone in the closet until the spring because it's winter.

87
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,572
Scott: You could just register in the spring, but then you got to pay five bucks.

88
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:13,636
Rym: This is just.

89
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:16,086
Rym: this is the Minimal regulation.

90
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,335
Rym: I think it's fine.

91
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,040
Scott: What's wrong with that?

92
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,508
Rym: Yeah, I have no problems with.

93
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,312
Scott: no problems with this.

94
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:21,800
Scott: now you had to register a car.

95
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:29,300
Scott: This is way easier than that and it you know And probably should be way more should probably have to take a test to make sure you know how to fly this stupid drone.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,168
Rym: Yep But I honestly feel like this is a good thing because one if we need to Insurrect against the government and we're using drones to do that.

97
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,917
Rym: We're just not registering them anymore dirt.

98
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,613
Rym: And Also, that's the situation where some of the other stuff we'll talk about tonight has to go on.

99
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:48,540
Rym: but also right now I think more people use drones not maliciously but just stupidly.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:59,840
Scott: Then I see a lot of film production crews and TV production crews using drones to get aerial shots And I think that is the current You know most practical and prominent use of drone.

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,699
Rym: But a lot of those uses are actually kind of illegal because of the no commercial use clauses for a lot of drone use in a lot of places.

102
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:16,833
Rym: But this specific regulation I think is fine And apparently they piggybacked on the old regulation for radio-controlled propeller driven airplanes.

103
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:18,116
Scott: Oh, that sounds good.

104
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:24,396
Scott: Yeah, and that those things While they are deaf, I'd rather be hit by the drone me to the airplane.

105
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,540
Rym: I've flown those things.

106
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,831
Rym: There are real airplanes with gas engines.

107
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,600
Rym: They're just tiny but they're not light.

108
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,948
Scott: Why don't we make a drone with a gas engine?

109
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,012
Scott: That's not lights.

110
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,818
Rym: pretty sure people have.

111
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:41,471
Rym: I mean I've seen remote controlled ones of those where there's a camera feedback and you're just flying a real plane Sitting on the ground.

112
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,157
Rym: don't crash it.

113
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:46,087
Rym: So, yeah Some other news going on.

114
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:49,100
Rym: So this is just a little bit but there's a town in North Carolina.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,780
Rym: So basically the south bad place the South's north.

116
00:06:53,142 --> 00:07:02,360
Rym: Yes in the US and in the town of Woodland, North Carolina The citizens of that town did not want a solar plant to happen in their town.

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,902
Scott: Well who was?

118
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,768
Scott: who wanted to put a solar plant in their town?

119
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:13,154
Rym: some company and apparently there already are two solar plants in The vicinity and a company wanted to put another one there are they like a power?

120
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:16,064
Rym: the power company or I don't know It's private.

121
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:19,236
Scott: Oh, they wanted to power like their own building like they had it.

122
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,420
Scott: They had their own office building.

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,640
Rym: They want a private company could generate power and put it on the grid.

124
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,790
Rym: I mean, I don't know about North Carolina regulations.

125
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,920
Scott: Sure, but do you get you get paid for doing that?

126
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,674
Rym: So the council not only rejected the proposal.

127
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:31,800
Scott: So this is the town council.

128
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,260
Rym: Yeah, okay, but voted on a complete moratorium on all solar farms henceforth, right?

129
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,372
Scott: They're probably just all anti not believe in global warming.

130
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:41,376
Scott: southern nut job.

131
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,440
Rym: one person in the town.

132
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,745
Scott: What part of this is news?

133
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:48,019
Rym: So one person in the town who was at the student at the student council at the council meeting?

134
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,169
Scott: They break the the South Shell.

135
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,980
Rym: very what do you what do you think?

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,323
Rym: There are the reasons that people at the meeting might have said they didn't want this solar B's in the south.

137
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,106
Scott: They're stupid.

138
00:07:59,126 --> 00:07:59,728
Scott: They're probably believing.

139
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:03,038
Rym: like what reason do you think one of those nimby's would say out loud?

140
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,510
Scott: That they you know, they don't believe in global warming.

141
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,814
Scott: solar power is dangerous.

142
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:12,146
Rym: you were an order of magnitude off So I gotta get crazier.

143
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,815
Rym: So some of the reasons were cancer the solar.

144
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,020
Rym: well cancer was one of them.

145
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,079
Rym: Okay, they can't tell me these things don't cause cancer.

146
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,431
Scott: Sure Cuz we know we can tell you a coal my coal power plant does cause cancer.

147
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:37,446
Rym: solar panels would suck up the solar energy going Into the town so plants wouldn't do as well and we wouldn't get as much sunlight Alright, so I mean obviously these are the crazies coming to the town council But the only reasons go to town council.

148
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:42,058
Scott: the people on the town council are slightly less crazy while still being stupid.

149
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:42,480
Scott: and southern.

150
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,405
Rym: Yeah, oh it would bright.

151
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,217
Rym: It might block photosynthesis for nearby farms.

152
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,020
Scott: That is not true.

153
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,304
Rym: That was a big thing.

154
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:54,920
Rym: one person complained that they've already surrounded her farm in solar plants and it lowered her property values.

155
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,515
Rym: But a reporter went and checked and there aren't solar plants near her property as far as they can tell.

156
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:00,860
Scott: and what about her property values?

157
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,704
Scott: Have they gone up or down?

158
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,431
Rym: Uh, it's North Carolina.

159
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,419
Scott: So nothing's worth anything anyway.

160
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:11,473
Rym: Okay, we might be applying a urbano centric and North centric view to this.

161
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,080
Scott: that is but that is also a factual view.

162
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:18,900
Scott: There's nothing wrong with being a something centric view if that view is also founded in truth.

163
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:22,960
Scott: Oh and the other truth centric view also have was the urbano centric.

164
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,280
Rym: They were afraid that if you build solar plants young people won't want to live there anymore.

165
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,560
Scott: I don't think young people care about what kind of power plants are there.

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,632
Scott: Also young people don't want to live in North Carolina.

167
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:41,532
Rym: No matter what power plant you have I don't think there's anything you can do to keep young people there except Entrench them in such poverty and ignorance that they do not know they can escape.

168
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:57,683
Scott: you can get young people to live there by Stop being a nimby and let awesome things be in your town like a roller coaster and an arcade And a business that isn't backwards and by you moving away from the town Like that.

169
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:05,456
Rym: tell you what if a small town like that could give me a job that pays even half what I make now With reasonable hours and has another equivalent employer.

170
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,280
Rym: so I could quit.

171
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,305
Rym: It's not a company town.

172
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,014
Scott: build a train and Ikea.

173
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:10,039
Rym: I can commute without a car.

174
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,975
Rym: I can see a 70 millimeter Panavision movie.

175
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:15,220
Scott: build a bunch of bike lanes.

176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,208
Rym: So I can see Hateful Aid on opening night in its real format.

177
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,953
Rym: There's bike lanes everywhere.

178
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,778
Rym: I can see the Opera.

179
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:22,339
Rym: if I want.

180
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,359
Scott: I can just walk in and see the screen.

181
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,380
Rym: I'd say there's an arcade but there really aren't arcades here, so I can't really hold them to that.

182
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,600
Rym: There aren't roller coasters here either, so I can't complain about that.

183
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:37,800
Scott: I can go to the game shop any night of the week, and there's like eight people playing netrunner.

184
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,520
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's got to be at least eight people in the town who play netrunner.

185
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,012
Scott: Well, no not eight people in town who play netrunner.

186
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:49,232
Scott: when you go to the meetup There's usually around eight people which means is way more than eight people who play.

187
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:58,802
Rym: so damage control for the town Argued that the actual reason they voted no was that the two previous solar projects did not benefit the town in the way that they expected.

188
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:06,384
Rym: but at the same time I cannot find evidence that it hurt the town in any way because they bought the land and The land is not worth that much anyway.

189
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:23,373
Rym: and further even if that is the reason the town council says they voted this way The opinions expressed by the townspeople are opinions by real voters who not only vote in America But are so politically active that they go to town council meetings.

190
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,640
Rym: people like me and Scott don't go to town council.

191
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,972
Scott: Well, that's that's how politics works.

192
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:31,785
Scott: if you go to a town council meeting It's because you have no job and you have nothing else to do.

193
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:36,970
Scott: if you have no job and nothing else to do is because you're dumb or Old and you don't know things.

194
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,034
Scott: if you know things you have a job and a life And you don't have time to go to town council meeting.

195
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,780
Rym: no not necessarily.

196
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,159
Rym: There are a lot of people who know things therefore ours.

197
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:47,035
Scott: We should change it and to make it just like it was in the 1700s.

198
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:48,763
Scott: We don't need to be like.

199
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,148
Scott: only property owners can vote.

200
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:50,570
Scott: it should be.

201
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,999
Scott: only people with jobs and brains can vote.

202
00:11:53,019 --> 00:12:02,720
Rym: ah But there are a lot of people with brains who can't get jobs And there's a lot of people who are disenfranchised not being because they don't have access to brain and beginning services.

203
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,526
Scott: Obviously, I was not Right.

204
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:14,422
Rym: that was just a crazy Sticks again thing about this is when tech issues like this come up in small town meet like I've tried to go to beacon town Council.

205
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,590
Rym: well beacons a city, but you actually ever go to it.

206
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:17,774
Rym: I went twice.

207
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,340
Rym: whoa you know what it was.

208
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:26,500
Rym: It was nothing, but inane bullshit that I couldn't affect and actually didn't care about because it literally didn't matter.

209
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:29,412
Scott: Nothing wasn't a solar panel for you to comment on.

210
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,239
Rym: there was not a solar panel for me to comment on.

211
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,660
Scott: Okay, why wasn't there a representative from the company that wanted to build it at the meeting?

212
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:41,960
Rym: Uh, I think you know say and I assume they had some sort of musical where they did their both sides.

213
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:45,774
Rym: And then there was a dramatic Person saying no, that's not true.

214
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:45,895
Scott: No.

215
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:46,360
Scott: That's not true.

216
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,248
Rym: There's the dramatic debate about evolution.

217
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,980
Rym: at some point William Jennings Bryan got up and gave his speech.

218
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:52,164
Rym: Oh what that was.

219
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:52,867
Rym: that was the plan.

220
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:54,131
Scott: you should be able to sue.

221
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,380
Rym: that was inherit the win not this town council meeting.

222
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:03,805
Scott: There should be a way to sue at like the next higher level of government of the lower level of government for making a decision Based on false information.

223
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,328
Rym: Hey, County.

224
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:05,071
Rym: Hey, County.

225
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,220
Rym: This city is so dumb you need to overstep them.

226
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,275
Rym: Yes, some states have mechanisms for that kind of thing.

227
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:17,583
Scott: for the federal government You should be able to go to any town wraps around Just a circle.

228
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:25,939
Scott: Yes, if you go to your mayor and the mayor against some scientists say the federal government, you know did Did something wrong based on false information?

229
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,004
Scott: So they have to undo.

230
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:32,720
Rym: so Tor has some problems like Tor is you don't say pretty well one.

231
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:41,958
Rym: it's used primarily by child porn and drug traffickers, but Tor also is Really easily compromised in that the NSA probably runs a lot of the.

232
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:46,475
Scott: Tor knows I mean, it's so popular and everyone knows it that it's sort of like.

233
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:53,750
Scott: yeah, it gets the job done But it's not super perfectly getting the job done in a mathematically Guaranteed locked in way.

234
00:13:54,012 --> 00:14:04,788
Rym: so researchers at MIT Have actually created a real alternative and it echoes some of the things that waste did which was we've talked about waste on GeekNights A bunch of times we're kind of waste fan.

235
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:07,600
Scott: I mean Tor and waste are not really alike at all.

236
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,843
Rym: Well, they serve a lot of similar purposes though It's just one.

237
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:17,259
Rym: what one was an application that offered like chat and all this stuff built in and one is just an anonymized Browse the web and communicate thing.

238
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Rym: Yeah, so you can probably guess what parts of waste this appropriated by its name because the name is vuvuzela.

239
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,040
Scott: Vuvuzela, so it's loud and annoying and you want to punch whoever's got one.

240
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,532
Rym: Ah, I imagine the net with these switches.

241
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,959
Scott: anyone who uses this needs a kickin.

242
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:39,300
Rym: I imagine the network admins and places that use this will feel that way about them much like I feel about vuvuzelas.

243
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:42,060
Rym: But the interesting thing is you should read MIT's paper.

244
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,060
Rym: I will link to it directly because in our list can the listener understand this paper?

245
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,397
Rym: So the threat model the as in this is the threat that vuvuzela is designed to avert.

246
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:53,660
Scott: what threat are they averting?

247
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,369
Rym: I'm gonna quote this because this is real important.

248
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:02,578
Rym: This is why this is better than Tor and why anonymized Data transfer and anonymized communication is real important.

249
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:10,986
Rym: So before the threat model what this is designed for on a high level Is that metadata is gathered about.

250
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:16,620
Rym: you like Scott went to this website and emailed these ten people with this frequency by person.

251
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:20,798
Scott: So even if we don't have the even if we encrypt all this information, right?

252
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,564
Scott: So the data is encrypted.

253
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:30,880
Scott: people can still see that X IP made a TCP IP connection to that IP These frequencies and sent this much data across the wire.

254
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:43,160
Scott: So if I you know, you can pretty much tell even if I'm using encryption, you know Time Warner can look at my traffic rates and which direction the traffic is going in and say he's using bit torrent for something.

255
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:48,396
Rym: Yep, probably most likely even if all of our chats are encrypted the NSA could figure out.

256
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:49,580
Rym: Rym and Scott know each other.

257
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,180
Scott: Yeah, they see a whole bunch of download and then they suddenly they see all the download stops and there's a stream of upload.

258
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,700
Scott: They're like, well that was a bit torrent transfer of this about this size probably a movie.

259
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:13,960
Rym: Joey Jojo emailed this one address a bunch of times on a regular basis Those emails but that address is of a mental health clinic that primarily treats her and you can start and either Joey Jojo or somebody knows needs help with the mental health clinic.

260
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:20,020
Rym: So the truth suit statements that justify this thing that MIT did are one.

261
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,596
Rym: officials of the NSA stated that if you have enough metadata, you don't really need content.

262
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:29,958
Rym: true and Separately quote we kill people based on metadata.

263
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:30,480
Scott: That's true.

264
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:35,618
Rym: So here's the threat model that they are attempting to circumvent but recently I'm quoting now.

265
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:52,515
Rym: But rusilla's design assumes that the adversary that controls all but one of the vuvuzela servers Users do not need to know which one Control an arbitrary number of vuvuzela clients meaning possibly every client

266
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,678
Scott: or possibly one client,

267
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:59,599
Rym: but yours And can monitor block delay or inject traffic on any network link.

268
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:05,566
Rym: That is a bigger threat model than I have ever considered in anything I have ever thought.

269
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:05,705
Rym: so.

270
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:14,509
Scott: in other words the NSA could set up this entire Network where every single node on the network every server and every client is just trying to spy on anyone who tries to use this Thing.

271
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:23,500
Scott: Yep Scott knows you come in and you start up one server and you add it to the network and you know for sure that one Server is yours that it is not compromised by the NSA.

272
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,920
Scott: It is running the true vuvuzela code that is not compromised and you spin up your vuvuzela client.

273
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,920
Scott: You can communicate securely without them.

274
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:37,120
Scott: No Any of those the entire rest of the network knowing jack shit about what you're doing.

275
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:43,380
Rym: So in a sense the NSA is probably going to run most of the nodes on this network.

276
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:53,060
Scott: So me and Rym can set up one server connect to each other and even if the NSA runs every other server and client on The whole network we can communicate in absolute perfect secrecy.

277
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,063
Rym: I've heard the term.

278
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:58,780
Rym: this is solipsistic security in the sense that I can only know myself, right?

279
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,745
Rym: Yep, I know my node.

280
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,009
Rym: So I'm good.

281
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,760
Rym: I only need to know about one and the one I control counts.

282
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:06,731
Rym: That's crazy.

283
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:11,079
Rym: Yeah They also is now and all those evil ones will just be helping you out.

284
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:21,467
Rym: so in this situation two users communicating through vuvuzela should have their communications protected if their two clients and Any server are in compromise.

285
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:26,040
Rym: We also assume that the server's public keys are known to all users.

286
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,204
Scott: That's what public keys?

287
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:27,907
Scott: yes, they're public.

288
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:28,288
Scott: Yeah.

289
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:31,640
Rym: Yeah, but you could come up with models where people share public.

290
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,180
Scott: It's anyway, right better generate your public key.

291
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:45,420
Rym: Well, though because they can still compromise the only other assumption is that the users have a separate mechanism to pre-share Each other's keys or at least discover who is on the other side of the key.

292
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,240
Scott: Otherwise, I mean you could still share the keys over the network But then you'd be giving away metadata of Scott and Rym shared keys.

293
00:18:52,641 --> 00:19:04,099
Scott: Yes, so Scott and I would trade like a USB stick once and then we're good we're good or some other website just has a bunch of keys and You go to that website and just search for someone and download their key.

294
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,180
Rym: It works based on think of like cold war spies.

295
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:11,380
Rym: So you have drop boxes that are bit their mailboxes, but they function like dead drops.

296
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:13,279
Rym: So I put a message in a mailbox.

297
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:18,699
Rym: My client puts that message there at some point between now and like 50 seconds from now.

298
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:30,024
Rym: But I'm also putting messages of randomly encrypted data into a random set of other drop boxes and basically, it's like all.

299
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:35,959
Rym: communication is two ships passing in the night and there's an infinite number of magic ships filled with bullshit.

300
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:40,338
Rym: and There's no mathematical way to determine bullshit from actual shit.

301
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:42,587
Rym: And you can have it.

302
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:45,000
Scott: and how does the person I'm trying to send the message to get the shit?

303
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:46,449
Rym: You can read the paper for that.

304
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:53,276
Rym: But basically because we know our keys We know we've our clients basically know which drop box to get the data from.

305
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,380
Scott: but no and no one else does.

306
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,450
Rym: No one else knows that we are communicating and there's too many other ships.

307
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,433
Scott: They can't find our ship.

308
00:19:58,694 --> 00:19:59,015
Scott: Yes.

309
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,797
Scott: They were looking.

310
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:08,427
Rym: so this is the kind of shit you need to do if you want to make a real secure communication of real secure networks and MIT is building this one.

311
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,180
Scott: So is there actually software you can get?

312
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,063
Scott: GitHub or something.

313
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:14,929
Rym: So researchers created it.

314
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,460
Rym: I believe they're running it in MIT right now.

315
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,690
Scott: So you have to code it from the paper to use it today.

316
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,638
Rym: Yes, or meet one of these people at MIT.

317
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:31,173
Rym: Follow this project if you care about the things that Tor is good at because this will do it better and I doubt it will be back doored.

318
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:40,906
Rym: so uber but for blank basically means we're gonna disrupt a market by getting rid of all the regulations, not having employees.

319
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:50,920
Scott: We're gonna set up a company that ignores all laws and just do evil things But be so convenient to the customer that we make a lot of money and then try to fight to keep our business around.

320
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,398
Rym: Never mind that a real- see uber, see FanDuel, see DraftKings.

321
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:57,387
Rym: Yep Never mind that a real company could have the same- AirBnB.

322
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:08,136
Rym: Like regular taxis in New York could have the same user interface as uber and Just they'd cost a little more than uber and people would still make you know actual livable money kind of.

323
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:09,280
Rym: but I digress.

324
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,524
Rym: gigster wants to be uber of Software development.

325
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:19,528
Scott: Well, that's a little more difficult because unlike say driving a car from A to B. It's a little harder to.

326
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,641
Scott: it's not just pay I'm done It's.

327
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:23,447
Scott: you know, there's a lot of stuff that goes into software development.

328
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,900
Rym: So apparently I sign up and I send you my idea.

329
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,653
Rym: Gigster then passes on to developers who sign up.

330
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,360
Scott: There's so many implementation details.

331
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:36,340
Scott: This is why you need like a company if you were working together every day to build the software.

332
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:44,719
Rym: Yeah, gigster will apparently make put a team together and have them Design it and then send back a functioning app for a flat fee.

333
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,430
Scott: But what about my input other than the idea?

334
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:48,755
Scott: Can I write a full spec?

335
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:49,940
Scott: How much spec do I write?

336
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,606
Scott: Well, you know, there's so much going on there.

337
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:55,180
Scott: Yeah, I gotta revise the spec after we see what can be implemented.

338
00:21:55,485 --> 00:22:02,848
Rym: I feel like No level of spec is going to make this work very well and this the sole purpose of this Nonsense.

339
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:06,048
Rym: business is To for a VC type person.

340
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:09,424
Scott: and if you can write good software, you're not working for gigster You have a job.

341
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,800
Scott: so it's like you're only getting shitty developers of this, right?

342
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,579
Rym: Or you're getting people who are between work and just want to get paid.

343
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:23,279
Rym: You know, you're probably gonna get mostly people who are currently in college Or also gonna submit the code they write for you to whatever their projects are inside of the college.

344
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,992
Scott: You're not getting someone you want.

345
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:35,780
Rym: Yeah So apparently gigster will own the code to the app it designs for you And it leases the software to you with a license.

346
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:37,798
Scott: It's not good.

347
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,378
Scott: So suppose I'll pay someone else to make something for them.

348
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,138
Scott: It's like no, I'm paying you to make it for me.

349
00:22:47,062 --> 00:23:05,600
Rym: I don't know if this company is trying to steal money from VCs or if they're trying to be a conduit for VCs to have their money stolen by other VC like I. I can't imagine any legitimate use for this Other than in a utopian world economy where everyone has enough money to eat and people only do this for fun.

350
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:09,354
Scott: I mean, I want to say this is gonna fail because I'm 90% sure it will.

351
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:10,920
Scott: just I'm surprised hasn't failed already.

352
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,104
Rym: But it was easy.

353
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,473
Scott: people are just so dumb and have so much money.

354
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:15,718
Scott: Maybe they'll know.

355
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:22,100
Rym: simultaneously There are probably developers who don't live in cities, but need work.

356
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,631
Rym: I don't know because there's not a lot of coding jobs outside of cities.

357
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:26,353
Scott: I don't know.

358
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:33,034
Rym: Yeah, but this The trend of Ubering business models worries me, but I'm amazed.

359
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:44,455
Rym: you see such a crass like Gigster is the kind of thing I would make up as a joke in like Robocop as a movie and the fact that it's an article come true.

360
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:46,220
Rym: Yeah, I feel like too many onion articles.

361
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,366
Rym: Oh, here's another onion article that came true.

362
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:53,200
Rym: Phillips pushed a firmware update to their light bulbs that locks out third-party light bulbs.

363
00:23:54,121 --> 00:24:01,465
Scott: Yeah, so this this is line of light bulbs you can gather LED light bulbs and the controllers, right and You can use like this.

364
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,251
Scott: There's open wireless networking protocol.

365
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:03,773
Scott: got Zigbee.

366
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:04,275
Scott: I've used it.

367
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,379
Scott: It's been around for a long time.

368
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,728
Scott: Yeah, it's only pot.

369
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,840
Scott: It's not something that's like a consumer thing, right?

370
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:21,620
Scott: It's it's mostly a. you know, when you're making products you would use it, right but And you can use it to like communicate with the light bulbs like, you know Turn them on and off when you're not home or change of colors or you know all kinds of stuff, right?

371
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,620
Scott: You communicate with the light bulbs of an app, but I would love to have an app.

372
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,226
Rym: There's just a map.

373
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,599
Rym: my house just control the light bulb.

374
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,412
Scott: It can sort of do stuff like that because I don't have light switches everywhere.

375
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:31,713
Rym: I want them.

376
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:40,927
Scott: But anyway anyway, so There they changed it to where you have to use their light bulbs or their approved light bulbs with it in the late if you Update your software.

377
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,580
Scott: You can't just use whatever light bulb you want.

378
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,655
Scott: You got to use their bulbs and it's just like what the fuck and you know.

379
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,812
Scott: on the one hand It's like it's easy to understand why they did this.

380
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,160
Scott: a they want you to buy their light bulbs.

381
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,922
Scott: they make more money.

382
00:24:50,982 --> 00:25:03,620
Scott: but be they're worried that if you put some shitty light bulb in there and it somehow explodes or causes other Damage because they're not you know accounting for every conceivable possible light bulb you might use in their software.

383
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,963
Scott: So they don't want to get sued So they're it's.

384
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:12,560
Scott: they're also preventing litigation but also being evil with the DRM not letting use whatever the hell light bulb you want.

385
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:20,020
Rym: But I feel like the middle of the road should be that Unlike like light bulbs that aren't up to spec if they cause a problem you void your warranty.

386
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,693
Scott: Yeah, most people do and you can't sue us and you agree.

387
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,662
Scott: not, you know, it's like that's that's him I don't know.

388
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:36,967
Rym: which can also in some ways BBS because of the whole like right to repair your own car thing Sure, like should be legally be allowed to let a non licensed Porsche mechanic Mechanic eyes your Porsche.

389
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: I probably wouldn't if I had a Porsche but You might want to and I feel like shouldn't it be required that you give me the diagrams and technically Specs of anything that I buy ever enough to where I could make any repair necessary?

390
00:25:49,563 --> 00:25:49,889
Scott: I'm

391
00:25:50,073 --> 00:26:04,920
Rym: this all Disappearing because we are some of the last people who grew up in an era like literally where when I bought my when we got Our first computer it came with this multi hundred page book that had pin outs Voltage diagrams and schematics of all the chips on the computer.

392
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:14,193
Rym: I bought a stereo that came with all that my mixer has that now and I bought that like Not that many years ago, but mixers are where they all have schematics are with.

393
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:15,498
Rym: is this that just disappearing?

394
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:17,305
Scott: hmm I think it's already disappeared.

395
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:19,375
Scott: Yeah, I mean people these days they buy an iPad.

396
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:33,806
Rym: you never open it true But while that's disappearing, I guess will Modern young nerds like young Millennials the generation after them see this as a bad thing Recognize that it's happening be afraid of it They don't even know anything about.

397
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,960
Rym: do they want control of their devices or have they given that up entirely?

398
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,908
Scott: Even know that it's an option?

399
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,218
Rym: is it okay that they don't know that it's not.

400
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:42,162
Scott: no But they don't.

401
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:42,805
Scott: no one knows.

402
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:44,634
Scott: even old no one knows except nerds.

403
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:45,317
Scott: nerds only.

404
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:52,279
Rym: no But the stereotype of a nerd is increasingly becoming someone who consumes technology, but does not know anything about it.

405
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,626
Scott: No, not a lot of people know.

406
00:26:53,646 --> 00:27:00,376
Rym: a lot of our nerds do back into the distance pull out Vuvuzela and live in our own darknet for the rest of time and then die out.

407
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:00,938
Scott: I hope so.

408
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:09,231
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

409
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:10,436
Rym: Do you have a thing of the day?

410
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:11,440
Rym: So apparently?

411
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:20,534
Scott: There's a fancier filler refrigerator you can buy from Samsung and this refrigerator has like a screen on the front and That screen can actually do some sort of cool things.

412
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:32,230
Scott: if you're just so ridiculously wealthy You could buy a refrigerator with a screen on the front And the most useful of those things is to display your calendar right the fuck there on your fridge where normally you'd look for it Right except now it's a digital calendar.

413
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,319
Scott: so you can get your Google Calendar synced up with it And you'll see all your good, you know, that's really freaking cool.

414
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:38,705
Rym: That'd be extra great cuz.

415
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:46,160
Rym: I'd make a sub calendar in Google of like what I'm gonna cook on different days and just be sitting Right there with the recipe and you could get reminders like from the fridge.

416
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:55,576
Scott: So you stand in the kitchen and just be like hey, I gotta remember, you know, we were eating breakfast this morning You know anyway, so I know the milk is bad, right?

417
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,560
Scott: It's it's kind of cool.

418
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:01,800
Scott: It's really expensive and probably would never buy this but you know if you're you know, it's it's okay.

419
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:11,299
Scott: apparently Google changed their API about how Google Calendar works And of course you can't just like a smart TV or so-called smart TV.

420
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,776
Scott: Nobody's making software updates to the Samsung fridge, right?

421
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:16,780
Scott: Just like Android phones.

422
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,185
Scott: No one's making software updates for those.

423
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:25,228
Rym: Oh the title of you the title of the thing you're linking to it's not an iPhone Right, so it's not iOS.

424
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:28,420
Scott: or they keep updating it or it's not Windows or they keep updating it, right?

425
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,530
Scott: They don't update this thing.

426
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:43,239
Scott: So There's this thread in the Google Calendar help forum that says can't sign into Google Calendar on my Samsung refrigerator and it's really long because I guess a lot of people have this refrigerator and They can no longer sign into Google Calendar on it.

427
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,479
Scott: And so now it's sort of like they paid a whole bunch of money for a refrigerator That no longer does the thing that they paid all that money for.

428
00:28:50,022 --> 00:29:00,300
Scott: You could have probably saved a bunch of money just by getting an old tablet and like taping it to the front of your refrigerator Something with updatable or open source software on it and you would have been better off.

429
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:02,470
Rym: This is why you should never buy a smart TV.

430
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,620
Rym: never buy any device that has a computer in it.

431
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,420
Rym: That's not a computer if you expect that computer to do generic.

432
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,030
Scott: I mean don't buy some weirdo, you know side.

433
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:15,300
Scott: you have to buy mainstream bits things that are supported.

434
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,043
Rym: But here's the thing.

435
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:20,300
Rym: a Samsung refrigerator seems pretty mainstream like a Samsung phone.

436
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,460
Rym: Samsung phones don't get updates necessarily.

437
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,189
Scott: Yeah, I mean smart TV like my TV is not a if it's not a Google device Microsoft device or an Apple device.

438
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,480
Scott: I pretty much can't trust that it's gonna get updates.

439
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,073
Rym: Yeah, just can't sign into Google Calendar on my Samsung.

440
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:41,560
Rym: It looks like Samsung's response is eat a bag of dicks.

441
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:43,467
Scott: Yeah, we don't care you bought our refrigerator.

442
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:44,210
Scott: We're doing this.

443
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,840
Rym: response is tell Samsung to eat a bag of dicks.

444
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,749
Scott: Yeah, we you're supposed to update your software.

445
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:49,251
Scott: What the fuck?

446
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:50,959
Rym: Wow this I'm surprised.

447
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,930
Scott: Nobody's just flashed the refrigerator the Linux or whatever.

448
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:58,405
Rym: Yeah, because desktop Linux came so far Refrigerator Linux is even further.

449
00:29:58,565 --> 00:29:59,649
Scott: you can run doom on it.

450
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:01,856
Scott: that refrigerator definitely runs doom.

451
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:06,206
Scott: I bet even doom to Guarantee you could be a doom on that refrigerator.

452
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,075
Scott: That'll be a pretty even quake one.

453
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:13,767
Rym: Yeah, I Ran quick one in software mode.

454
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:17,219
Scott: if you can run Google Calendar, you might be able to run quake one.

455
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:24,480
Rym: So my thing of the day This is a video got internet cuz it can access Google Calendar You.

456
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:34,565
Rym: So actually what I really want to see is I want the fridge to head to figure out what's in it and Order groceries.

457
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,880
Scott: for me and within our lives that'll happen.

458
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,060
Rym: Yeah, RF IDs, but then we won't be able to update the firm.

459
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,760
Scott: No, even just computer imaging like the self-driving car can drive.

460
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,898
Scott: There's no reason a camera inside the fridge won't be able to tell milk from orange.

461
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,827
Rym: Oh, yeah I mean that Vivino amp I use.

462
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,100
Rym: I take a picture of a wine label without not even like a barcode, right?

463
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,946
Rym: Tell me what that wine is just before.

464
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:57,599
Scott: a bunch of can't little tiny shitty cameras inside your fridge and a database and eventually You know, it'll it'll be good.

465
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:02,855
Rym: I wanted to email and be like yo dawg You put that leftover mac and cheese in there a week ago that shit.

466
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,040
Rym: Well, it's like sailed.

467
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,976
Scott: I mean you're at the grocery store and you'd be like do I need sour cream?

468
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:07,438
Scott: and it will go.

469
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,566
Scott: ding I see a sour cream in your fridge.

470
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:12,396
Scott: the date on that sour cream is last month.

471
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:13,360
Rym: Why would I do?

472
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,446
Rym: Store, it's just good.

473
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:19,058
Rym: The fridge is just ordering from fresh direct without my intervention.

474
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:19,780
Rym: That's what happened.

475
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,565
Scott: That would be even better.

476
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:21,893
Rym: and when I come home it did.

477
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:25,768
Rym: there's a sour cream already delivered and I take it and I go.

478
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:27,053
Rym: why did it order sour cream?

479
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:30,492
Scott: and I know the fridge has access to your Google Calendar and knows and you'll be out of town.

480
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:31,560
Scott: It doesn't order the sour cream.

481
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:39,251
Rym: Yep and there's an expired sour cream in the fridge and there's a red light pointing at it in the fridge telling me that that's the One to get rid of.

482
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:43,435
Scott: no I reach in the fridge and start and I grab it and it'll say throw that shit out.

483
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,544
Rym: Yeah, just yells at me Don't eat that.

484
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:48,176
Rym: So our friend showed it this over the weekend.

485
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:48,860
Rym: We're having a party.

486
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,500
Rym: It's called afterglow light suit segment.

487
00:31:51,921 --> 00:32:01,020
Rym: It is just this crazy amazing video of two dudes wearing these custom-made suits covered in LEDs skiing down a mountain at night.

488
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:17,355
Rym: okay, this is crazy awesome to watch and as my follow-up thing of the day here is a longer video of How they made this crazy video with all this lighting down a mountain And it looked like it was really really hard to make this thing.

489
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,306
Scott: the pride sponsors They did corporate variety.

490
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:24,460
Rym: They had huge sponsors and I find out that I did not say who the sponsors are.

491
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,932
Rym: So that was ad dollars well spent dudes.

492
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,017
Scott: Fuck you sponsors.

493
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:37,080
Rym: Yeah These videos are super amazing though in the moment new book clubs coming soon old book club was the wheel of time.

494
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:39,232
Rym: We're gonna be live at Pac South.

495
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:48,103
Rym: We have three Three panels at Pac South then mag fest then MAGFest where we have fucking like seven panels Jesus.

496
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:50,298
Scott: then there's like an anime Boston and a PAX East.

497
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,439
Scott: after that I don't know what the order is.

498
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,315
Rym: We have to have at least four panels or we don't get our business.

499
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:58,020
Rym: at anime Boston We'll say thank icon will be coming up at some point.

500
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,389
Rym: I assume Scott's skipping it but I'll be doing four panels.

501
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,875
Rym: have to say you should come.

502
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,020
Rym: I already put in our four panels.

503
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:11,000
Rym: so we'll say I Enjoy zenkai Khan, but here's what I'm gonna do because you see small cons, but we don't need to see other panels.

504
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:12,446
Rym: I'm gonna do our panels.

505
00:33:13,209 --> 00:33:16,000
Rym: I'm gonna eat Amish food like all day on Saturday.

506
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:25,440
Rym: I'm not even going on Friday going Friday night Amish food all day Saturday Sunday I'm gonna play board games and get drunk in that bar by the by on Main Street.

507
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:27,857
Scott: Why don't we just go home on Sunday?

508
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,706
Rym: I'm gonna stick around perhaps.

509
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:31,850
Rym: I'm gonna leave like Sunday.

510
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,074
Rym: early evening is my plan.

511
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:38,249
Rym: Anyway, we The Amtrak goes to the con.

512
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:39,453
Rym: That's the only reason I go.

513
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:41,220
Scott: that's it's true, but it still sucks.

514
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:44,640
Rym: Anyway, but yeah, if you live near zenkai Khan, you should just go like you can drive there.

515
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,858
Scott: I mean no matter how shitty the con is if it's that close to you and thank icons pretty good Like if you live in a place like that, you're not getting a lot of nerdery.

516
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,333
Rym: Thank icon is like 10 derpy cons worth of entertainment.

517
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:54,634
Rym: Sure.

518
00:33:54,654 --> 00:33:55,778
Rym: Yes, not even joking.

519
00:33:55,879 --> 00:34:01,807
Rym: That's true but we were doing Atari game design designing game rules on Saturday and Sunday both at 1 p.m.

520
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:06,024
Rym: And also on Saturday in the evening Early evening.

521
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,219
Rym: as soon as I have more details, I will tell you there was a third panel.

522
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,625
Rym: Scott's not on it.

523
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,739
Rym: He's gonna go play games like a smart person.

524
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:24,175
Rym: Yeah, but I'll be on this panel and you want to see this panel I can't promise we'll video it either and I'm pretty sure Because the person running the panel is a full order of magnitude more famous than we.

525
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,620
Rym: are panels gonna fail.

526
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:40,600
Rym: Maybe it's weird because on one hand that person told us that like we would be overqualified to be on the panel But on the other hand that person is so much more well-known than we are That well known and qualified are not necessarily the same thing exactly.

527
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,429
Rym: But I feel like they're also qualified.

528
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,335
Rym: but it should be a good panel.

529
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:43,697
Rym: Mm-hmm.

530
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:56,770
Rym: Yeah So Yahoo, at least the story that the tech media is saying is that Yahoo doesn't have QA Anymore and it's awesome and everything's better.

531
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,360
Rym: now that they're quote coding with no net.

532
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,089
Rym: That's kind of not true.

533
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,190
Rym: Yeah.

534
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,360
Scott: Well, I mean it Basically, usually when you make software on a team, right?

535
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,320
Scott: You'll have a developer and they'll write some code and then they got a hand that share that code with other people.

536
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:18,296
Scott: But before you do that You know you double and triple check your code to make sure you're not sharing code this garbage.

537
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,847
Scott: because if you share garbage code With someone they like hey that shit.

538
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,012
Scott: You just sent me that patch.

539
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:23,076
Scott: It just doesn't work.

540
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:23,880
Scott: Did you even run this?

541
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,920
Scott: Yeah, you just wrote it and didn't even do anything.

542
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,763
Scott: What the fuck's wrong like?

543
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:30,940
Rym: if I write a script to give to someone else to run I at least run it once on my own.

544
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,384
Rym: Like okay.

545
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:32,492
Rym: Yeah, it worked right.

546
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:33,460
Scott: you make sure it works.

547
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:38,140
Scott: And then you'll have QA people who are not developers.

548
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:43,535
Scott: Double triple quadruple quintuple check it in every possible conceivable way.

549
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:44,900
Scott: And why do you do this?

550
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,760
Scott: Why doesn't the developer just do this?

551
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,440
Scott: And the reason the developer doesn't just do this is because the developer could be writing code.

552
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,152
Scott: The QA person doesn't have the skills and knowledge to write code.

553
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,978
Scott: if they did they'd be a developer instead.

554
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,402
Rym: pretty much So.

555
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:06,244
Scott: this way the developer can develop more and then the QA person will find all the bugs do work that the Developer could do.

556
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,214
Scott: but now the developer can focus on developing.

557
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,760
Scott: the QA person can find the bugs.

558
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:20,280
Scott: Then once they report those bugs It won't take the developer much work to fix them because the QA person Investigated them so thoroughly and this way you get to be much more efficient everywhere.

559
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:33,260
Scott: so the trend over the past bunch of years has been this idea of Test-driven development or at least lots of testing which is where you write Automated you get the computer to do the tests for you.

560
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:42,697
Scott: So instead instead of or in addition to having QA people manually check over all the code and run all the programs You have computer programs that check the computer program.

561
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:50,900
Rym: now again This both of these just like the thing of you know QA people testing Unit tests or test driven development in the right situation is the right thing.

562
00:36:50,960 --> 00:37:01,679
Rym: Like if you have code that say is taking a huge set of structured like XML data like gigabytes of nonsense XML Transforming it into some other kind of data and calculating things.

563
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:07,480
Rym: You don't want humans like plugging that data through and then like double-checking math or anything.

564
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:18,120
Rym: You want an application that puts the data in to the code as a black box See the data that came out and it knows what the answer should be and then checks to see if the answer that should come.

565
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:31,980
Scott: Testing is is a perfectly valid and important and useful thing, you know, there are a lot of different methodologies Places to test right and you should use tests often if not in many places, right and it's just so useful.

566
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:42,819
Scott: think about it's like you write some code and Now you run it you make sure it works and then you run the tests and it's test in there for all sorts of things And all you do is say run tests and you wait and it'll check and be like, hey, you know what?

567
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,227
Scott: Yeah, your code worked whatever it did the thing you thought it was gonna do.

568
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:51,252
Scott: but you actually Reintroduced this bug that someone introduced a long time ago.

569
00:37:51,272 --> 00:38:01,899
Scott: and because they wrote a test for the time They made that bug we were able to automatically find out with no one having to do any work Additional work that your new code makes that bug happen again.

570
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:05,390
Scott: So before you share the code fix that bug and make sure these tests pass

571
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:09,928
Rym: now that sort of regression testing is probably the best Use case for test driven, but you

572
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:15,820
Scott: also, you know write a new test for you the new code You just wrote especially if maybe the code you just wrote is a bug fix in and of itself.

573
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,759
Scott: Yeah, and if anyone you know and then for the future if anyone makes that bug happen and so on and that's a good thing To do it doesn't you know hurt?

574
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,205
Scott: but What Yahoo is doing is basically saying?

575
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:27,553
Scott: Hey, that's pretty much all we need.

576
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:29,540
Scott: We don't need the QA people, right?

577
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:35,098
Rym: That's a bad idea and the way they just at least the way this article describes what they're doing.

578
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:48,707
Rym: What they're describing are unit tests in a test driven environment But they're describing it like it's this like an amazing paradigm shift like most large software development companies Do both right?

579
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,895
Rym: So that's this is not novel, right?

580
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:55,250
Scott: So the thing that bothers me here That's obviously a problem is the point of having the QA people.

581
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,991
Scott: is the developers can spend less time Doing the QA part and just develop.

582
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:05,459
Scott: if you make the developers do QA You have one person doing two jobs.

583
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:06,604
Scott: Are you paying?

584
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:11,000
Scott: did you give all those QA salaries to the developers and other developers doing QA's work?

585
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:18,087
Scott: No, but you gave yeah, you gave him twice as much work probably and it's like yeah as much even if you're testing is so Good is not as good as QA.

586
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,458
Scott: No, did you give any people find shit that tests don't find all the time.

587
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:32,420
Rym: Yep now there's this separate problem because one of the things that at least Yahoo pointed out was that What they found just sort of analyzing their internal stuff is that the human QA process?

588
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:58,020
Rym: Was injecting a lot of human error that QA would what I'm reading between the lines that because I see this You know in all the work that I've done a lot of times QA is Introducing work where they're finding issues that aren't really issues due to either them misunderstanding what the code should do Them finding issues that are technically problems But that don't actually affect users or that don't affect the things in material ways.

589
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:00,892
Rym: And then there isn't a good process for someone to say don't fix that

590
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:02,760
Scott: or mark is don't fix

591
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:17,779
Rym: yeah, but I find a lot of companies do not have a rigorous methodology for doing that or they don't have people who have the ability to say those things or Developers who are looking for low-hanging fruit because they don't want to be doing the real work.

592
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:24,140
Rym: We'll fix a million shitty little bugs Because they don't have the management watching them and telling them no only work on this one.

593
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,018
Scott: The other thing is that in my experience as a programmer, right?

594
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:34,260
Scott: I don't write tests usually because the code I write isn't medical devices and isn't factory machines and isn't space shuttles.

595
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,796
Scott: So it's not really that big a deal if there's a bug in production.

596
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:40,411
Scott: It's like oh, no Someone's picture is offset by a few pixels.

597
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:44,668
Rym: I feel like I was actually in the same boat Like nothing Yahoo does is mission-critical, right?

598
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:48,020
Scott: So in that case, it's like you're unless your bug is so catastrophic.

599
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:51,293
Scott: It's like do you even need to test it all?

600
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:52,400
Scott: do you even eat QA people?

601
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,126
Scott: It's like yeah, you'll feel if you run the code yourself, you know, and you make sure it works It's gonna be 99% good.

602
00:40:58,146 --> 00:41:05,480
Scott: and all those in line unless you're really bad developers and all the ad the but it'll be bugs in Production but big whoop you'll just fucking fix them later.

603
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:09,820
Scott: You see Twitter is basically down with the fail whale for like its first two years of existence.

604
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,748
Scott: And no, it didn't fuck them over at all.

605
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,757
Scott: Yeah, so who really gives a shit now?

606
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:14,540
Scott: really bad important.

607
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:29,192
Rym: there is a big difference between package software development like here is our Application that we sell that you run on computers or on servers version 4.8.11 versus here is a website that we are hosting and iterating on develop.

608
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:38,876
Rym: because say I push some code and it fucks up a Website I can just revert it back that night To the previous version because the previous version or that

609
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,077
Scott: minute

610
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:46,780
Rym: Yeah, the previous version of the code right before I push that other code can't be worse than what just broke catastrophically.

611
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:51,760
Rym: Yeah at worst the old bug is still there, but if I ship software on a refrigerator.

612
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:53,964
Scott: It's got to be right.

613
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:57,696
Rym: so there no one can update that refrigerator, but my worry is that.

614
00:41:57,977 --> 00:42:01,045
Rym: but like, you know Because of the nature of my work.

615
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:02,469
Rym: I kind of have to use LinkedIn.

616
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:10,464
Rym: And so I see things people post on LinkedIn and there's a lot of people who are Bandying this.

617
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:18,799
Rym: Yahoo got rid of QA around as a good idea in Places where it is not a good idea to save money by not having QA people this firewall.

618
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:25,069
Rym: Yep I also feel like people don't know the difference between Quality assurance as a process versus QA.

619
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,834
Rym: as you've got people testing code.

620
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:27,837
Rym: QA is a process.

621
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:28,860
Rym: It's not just a checkbox.

622
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,980
Scott: You also have to make a value a cost-benefit analysis, right?

623
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,820
Scott: So if you're writing something that's not a space shuttle software or refrigerator software.

624
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,880
Scott: Yep What would the cost to you to be of the bugs that go through?

625
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,815
Scott: Get through versus the cost of hiring QA people.

626
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:43,680
Rym: Let's say GeekNights, right?

627
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,342
Rym: We don't have a QA.

628
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:48,960
Rym: per you know the QA is Scott updates the website and I bitch if it breaks, right?

629
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:50,830
Scott: Okay, and it's not a big deal.

630
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:51,715
Scott: So now think about it.

631
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:52,560
Rym: guys is down for a day.

632
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,785
Rym: How much money do we lose Scott?

633
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:54,528
Scott: zero?

634
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:54,849
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:55,451
Scott: All right.

636
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:57,600
Scott: Here's the other cost-benefit analysis.

637
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:02,299
Scott: Let's say you have a developer and they can just write code check it a little bit and put it up.

638
00:43:02,843 --> 00:43:05,180
Scott: You have another developer who has to write unit tests for everything.

639
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,440
Scott: You're losing the efficiency on the developer who has to write all the unit test.

640
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,586
Rym: He's 40% slower.

641
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:18,772
Scott: and because now he's gonna spend all these time writing these goddamn tests The QA person would have been writing and if you can read from Scott's Verbal language they're like read between the lines.

642
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:20,040
Rym: developers hate that shit.

643
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,200
Scott: They'll probably quit if there's a lot of them who drank the Kool-Aid, but I yeah.

644
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,639
Rym: But I know a lot of developers who would quit if they had to do QA.

645
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:29,874
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you told me I had to write unit tests for things that weren't important.

646
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:30,496
Scott: It's like no.

647
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:30,918
Scott: Sorry.

648
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:36,980
Scott: See ya Yeah, but so now if a developer has to write all these goddamn tests, they're gonna be so much slower at working.

649
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,156
Scott: Someone's gonna be like no no no the increase their efficiency because the find the bugs and whatever.

650
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:43,083
Scott: but we don't care about the bugs You already determined.

651
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:47,080
Scott: the cost-benefit analysis is such that the bugs getting through is not the end of the world.

652
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:50,510
Scott: But now how much you're how much development.

653
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,900
Scott: you could have had two new features instead of unit tests for the one feature you had.

654
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:54,823
Scott: Right.

655
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:59,498
Scott: so is it more worth it to you to have three new features or one super rock-solid feature?

656
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:01,546
Scott: now You have to make that sort of decision.

657
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:11,652
Scott: all right, so I guess Yahoo has decided that they want You know fewer things done more rock-solidly But actually less rock-solidly than they were before.

658
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:17,293
Rym: because now QA people just the tests Yeah, so I have more like my experience.

659
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:21,151
Rym: You know my job almost every job I've had has been like the mission-critical.

660
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:25,828
Rym: people might die crazy bullshit and package software and all this stuff.

661
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:31,354
Rym: and in my experience the best QA processes involve dedicated QA.

662
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:36,840
Rym: But basically the people doing the QA are also developers.

663
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:39,609
Scott: But then couldn't they be developing aren't you?

664
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:42,860
Rym: so we already have all the developers we need to develop forward.

665
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,080
Scott: But if somebody could be a developer you could develop other things.

666
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,683
Scott: It's like you don't.

667
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:50,200
Scott: why would you use a person who cool has developed skills to do QA work?

668
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:55,160
Scott: That's like because that's like if I hired a NASA engineer who could make a space shuttle to fix my car.

669
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:58,520
Scott: It's like I could be having them making a space shuttle its wasted resource.

670
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:00,325
Rym: No Because if it's mission-critical.

671
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,452
Scott: I made my toilet out of gold when I made it out of.

672
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:08,639
Rym: here's a hypothetical example from a Job I had before couple jobs before the job I have now.

673
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:12,514
Rym: So let's say you've got some pretty mission-critical software like.

674
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:17,000
Scott: it's not people will die But it's like a lot of people will lose a lot of money.

675
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:23,458
Rym: Yeah, like big deal if shit goes south in the software that is going to be deployed It's important enough that you should test it.

676
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,703
Rym: So you have to.

677
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,007
Scott: it's not just a website.

678
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:30,660
Rym: you have a real crack development team like serious people working together making the software.

679
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:32,365
Rym: It needs to be tested.

680
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:39,028
Rym: the testing is complex if you hire people who are QA Specialists, but are not developers at all.

681
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:45,469
Rym: They're generally not capable of writing the kinds of tools You need to test that efficiently and they end up.

682
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,900
Rym: the developers end up needing to write the testing tools for them to use.

683
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:55,820
Rym: If the developers were writing the testing tool if we had developers who are doing the QA They would want to do the job quicker.

684
00:45:56,142 --> 00:45:59,480
Rym: They would write the testing tool to be completely automated to not have to do the work.

685
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:01,354
Scott: I think that's really the best way to go.

686
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:04,957
Scott: It's like The developers who are making the software, right?

687
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,093
Scott: They don't make them test too much because then you'll get less software.

688
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:13,220
Scott: have someone else whose only job it is To write tests because they'll get really good at it.

689
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,759
Scott: They'll be able to write more tests than you know.

690
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,154
Scott: Then like the three developers code that they're testing but that person can't be like.

691
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:27,222
Scott: if my job is only to test code I can test the code of like five developers and I'm just one And Right.

692
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:36,299
Scott: I could write the test and do the testing and do everything all at once and you'd get the rock solidness But you also would get the efficiency at the same time.

693
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:40,440
Rym: Yeah And this does discount UAT and all those other kinds of things.

694
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,458
Rym: We're just talking about QA like the basic babies.

695
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:45,369
Scott: first Make sure it doesn't crash at a QA.

696
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,660
Scott: make sure the number that one plus one comes out is two and not as five.

697
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:53,254
Rym: But you know to get to your point the specific problem is so you get you know upon upgrade.

698
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:55,200
Rym: fatal error at startup.

699
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:56,548
Rym: Application fails.

700
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:57,655
Rym: Here's the log.

701
00:46:57,716 --> 00:46:58,340
Rym: Here's the error.

702
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:03,560
Rym: That's not that useful because now the developer still has to do all the work and test them to figure it out.

703
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,960
Rym: I'd rather have a QA person who knows the code enough to say well it failed in that class.

704
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:12,559
Rym: Let me look at the code and see if I can figure out what the problem is.

705
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,780
Rym: Right, if you have a person say yo dog no pointer exception your serialization is fucked.

706
00:47:18,222 --> 00:47:23,545
Scott: You could even make so if that person could even be good enough just to fix bugs like you have their job is just there Developer.

707
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,760
Scott: they're just only a bug fixer and not a feature maker.

708
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:28,692
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times you will work on open source projects.

709
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,420
Scott: All they do is fix other people's bugs.

710
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,091
Scott: Yeah, they don't write any new stuff.

711
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:36,100
Scott: They just go to an open source project They find bugs they fix them and they submit their patches to fix them.

712
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:45,519
Rym: So if you're crazy mission-critical like, you know, and when I was in the hospital like people might die mission-critical Cross-development you have a you have two teams developing two things.

713
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:55,719
Rym: Then when you get to the point of like it's stable and ready for testing you swap Projects and now their job is to write the tools and test the other person's stuff.

714
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:56,463
Rym: Mm-hmm.

715
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,656
Rym: That is what you do if people will die.

716
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:02,933
Scott: Yep I don't think that's done and you also check it like many more than one time.

717
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:07,515
Rym: Yeah, check it so many times Yeah, but that that's when you go, you know people like to make fun of like.

718
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:17,020
Rym: not necessarily add but like the waterfall model or like Methodologies of software development all methodologies is stupid if you're doing mission-critical stuff like people will die.

719
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:21,271
Rym: Having a defined methodology just means it is very well defined.

720
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,575
Rym: what is tested where and when.

721
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:27,169
Rym: you can very quickly converge on failure And you can very quickly identify where something got fucked.

722
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,095
Rym: Mm-hmm, but you don't need that.

723
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:32,723
Rym: if you're running Yahoo Games It's okay.

724
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,888
Scott: Yahoo Games is broken.

725
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:36,780
Scott: Oh my god, someone shot the moon in hearts and didn't get the right score.

726
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:38,127

736
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,460
Rym: So I haven't put this information on the actual site yet.

737
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:27,280
Rym: I kind of hinted at it on Twitter and a little bit in the forum, but It's not officially announced yet, so I'm burying it down here for people who actually listen to the end of the show.

738
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:30,218
Rym: But so you know that third panel I was talking about.

739
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:44,041
Rym: it's just me It's not Scott because Scott we do our usual lectures But occasionally I will be asked to join someone else's panel Just because I go to dev and I actually respond when people email me and Scott's kind of surly and you know how the deal Is.

740
00:50:44,483 --> 00:51:01,045
Rym: but so I'm going to be on very likely This is like 90 something percent confirmed at Pac South other than Atari game design and designing game rules an unnamed panel on horror in games With Chris Straub.

741
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:06,500
Rym: He's the person moderating it and I'm just a panelist and some other people at least one other person.

742
00:51:07,342 --> 00:51:17,476
Rym: I won't name any names other than that yet because I can't necessarily confirm them, but it'll be Saturday at 5 30 p.m in a panel room to be determined.

743
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:19,162
Rym: so 1 p.m.

744
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,308
Rym: On Saturday 1 p.m.

745
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,834
Rym: On Sunday and a 5 30 p.m.

746
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:26,020
Rym: On Saturday is the horror panel.

747
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:28,620
Rym: I don't know if I'll be able to video it and get it out to you guys.

748
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:31,997
Rym: Apparently, I'm an expert on horror games.

749
00:51:32,058 --> 00:51:33,792
Rym: now It seems like this came mostly out of that.

750
00:51:33,832 --> 00:51:52,300
Rym: five nights at Freddy's video I did and some other stuff and I kind of realized scarily that I actually am up on the current state of contemporary short horror fiction and I'm actually Pseudopod and other sources, so I think it's actually me a good panel.

751
00:51:52,802 --> 00:51:57,599
Rym: So I suggest you line up for it because Chris is way more famous than we are.

752
00:51:58,141 --> 00:52:01,933
Rym: So our panels don't always fill all the way, but I suspect this one will.

753
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:08,627
Rym: and now I leave you with the thing That Scott will never hear literally the opposite of Zen Some sort of sound.

754
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:15,719
Rym: if you're clever you can figure out where these things come from I feel like only Chris Reimer is betting a thousand in terms of actually finding them.

755
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:20,447
Scott: I ain't got no time for nobody.

756
