1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,429
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 23rd, 2021.

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:09,630
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:13,197
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,208
Rym: And this is GeekNights' Night.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,620
Rym: We are talking about The Bat-Man.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,739
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,479
Rym: So there was a Democratic, well there was a primary election in New York City.

8
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:27,680
Scott: Which effectively is the real election.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,203
Rym: That's the thing.

10
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:33,434
Rym: If you don't live in New York, the thing about our elections is that the general election basically never matters.

11
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:34,400
Rym: The Democrat always wins.

12
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:36,260
Rym: And they're closed primaries.

13
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,555
Scott: There are a couple places where that's not true.

14
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,179
Scott: Very small places.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,600
Rym: There are bad parts of New York State and even bad parts of New York City.

16
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,000
Scott: I think there are, like there's a handful of New York City Council people who are Republicans.

17
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,260
Scott: Like literally a handful.

18
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:51,362
Rym: Yep.

19
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:56,320
Rym: But basically, the Democratic primary is what actually matters.

20
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:00,160
Rym: And it's a closed state so only people who are members of the party can vote.

21
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,739
Rym: And even in a relatively progressive place, like not that many people vote in the primaries.

22
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:10,820
Rym: And this year, this election that just happened yesterday, was a big goddamn deal for so many reasons.

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,027
Rym: We're not going to get into it.

24
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:13,134
Rym: This is not a news.

25
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:14,100
Rym: This is just what we were doing.

26
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,920
Scott: There are, out of 51 people, there are 3 Republicans in the New York City Council.

27
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:26,320
Rym: But this was notable, one, because for some of the races, there were a ton of people.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,660
Rym: Like for our city council district, god there were like 15 people on the ballot.

29
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,979
Rym: It took me a while to research them and figure out who to vote for.

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,500
Scott: Yeah, ours also had quite a few, maybe 6 or 7, but we knew who they were at least.

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,300
Scott: We knew enough about a few of them that we knew who to vote for and just ignored them.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,020
Rym: Ours was so big that AOC was even like, of these like 16 people, these 6 are good.

33
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,513
Rym: But I'm not going to tell you which of them to vote for.

34
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:54,740
Rym: What are these 6?

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,000
Scott: Because you don't want to, you know, if you don't know enough, it's like, I don't know.

36
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:05,239
Rym: I had to spend more time researching this goddamn primary than any election I've ever voted in as a result.

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,635
Rym: But the other cool thing, there were a big number of very progressive candidates and New York did something we've never really had before.

38
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,560
Rym: This is pretty new for us.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,168
Rym: New York City.

40
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:17,959
Scott: It's city only.

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:27,570
Rym: We have ranked choice voting, so I can be like, I want Wiley to be mayor, but if Wiley doesn't win, I'd rather have Garcia than Adams.

42
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,616
Rym: I could literally vote that way.

43
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:30,680
Rym: And that is awesome.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,140
Scott: There are other places that have been doing it that way, but most places in the United States at least do not do it that way.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:47,849
Scott: And it's kind of annoying because when you're voting, it's like on the same ballot, you might have to vote for city stuff and you'll be able to rank all the city people like mayor.

46
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,600
Scott: But then it'll be like, okay, vote for the Manhattan DA.

47
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:55,995
Scott: The Manhattan DA is actually a state position, so there's no ranking there.

48
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:57,780
Scott: You're just picking one person and that's it.

49
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:01,371
Rym: And the state is weirdly deeply opposed to ranked choice voting.

50
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,879
Rym: Really, generally, centrists and conservatives are opposed to it.

51
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:09,420
Rym: In terms of popular opinion, people have a low opinion of ranked choice voting for some reason.

52
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,419
Scott: I mean, we voted for ranked choice voting, so it's clearly popular here.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,680
Rym: I think there's going to be an initiative on the ballot to overturn ranked choice voting in the general election this year.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,345
Scott: Well, we'll see.

55
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:21,931
Scott: I'll write no.

56
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,186
Rym: But that Manhattan DA race was a good example.

57
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:29,900
Rym: There is one mayor candidate and two really progressive candidates.

58
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:33,399
Rym: The two really progressive candidates are basically splitting the vote between each other.

59
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:37,820
Rym: And because it's not ranked choice, likely the mayor candidate will win.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,455
Rym: If it was ranked choice, all the progressive people would be like, here's my number one.

61
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,459
Rym: Here's my number two.

62
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:44,198
Rym: Not going to rank the "meh" one.

63
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:49,776
Rym: But the opening bit of this, you know, we voted.

64
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,320
Rym: It was fine.

65
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:58,380
Rym: And I have gotten more mail, physical mail, about this election than any election in my life.

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Rym: Our mailbox was full today of stuff that didn't make it in time for the election.

67
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,140
Scott: It's because there were more things, you know, positions.

68
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:13,136
Rym: And there were more people who were viable candidates for a lot of these positions.

69
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:13,999
Rym: There was a lot going on.

70
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:21,060
Rym: But it was notable that there's so much going on for not even a midterm election, but an off-year election.

71
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,819
Rym: The elections that Americans basically don't vote in.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,917
Scott: I've been voting for like, you know, I've been voting in every election here for like, you know, 10 years.

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,640
Scott: And yet it's like, you know, a lot of the earliest years I was in living in New York City, I was voting.

74
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:45,760
Scott: But I wasn't really voting that much, not because I wasn't going to vote, but because there were so many just like unopposed, you know.

75
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:46,621
Scott: Right?

76
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,854
Scott: It's just like nobody, you know, it's like, it was like, yep, that's the person.

77
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,280
Scott: What are you voting for, right?

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,939
Scott: It's like there wasn't a choice, really.

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,560
Scott: You know, even when I was like voting for de Blasio, it's like you go in and it's like, I guess I'm voting for de Blasio.

80
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,016
Scott: There's no one else on this fucking ballot, right?

81
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,593
Scott: And now you go in and people are actually trying to, you know, to win.

82
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:08,157
Scott: So there's all kinds of people on there now.

83
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,260
Scott: So it's now a thing.

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Rym: But by over under now, I'm trying to figure out, I want to hold this place a bet.

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:21,080
Rym: What day will I receive the last piece of primary specific mail from one of these candidates?

86
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,920
Scott: If it's not, if it wasn't today, it'll be like tomorrow.

87
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,267
Rym: I got a ton today.

88
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,640
Rym: I'm going to bet that I'll get the last one on Monday.

89
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:29,889
Scott: I got like three yesterday.

90
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,820
Scott: I've done a really good job of unsubscribing.

91
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,940
Rym: Yeah, but they just really good.

92
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:37,828
Scott: I unsubscribe from like paper mail that comes in the mailbox.

93
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:43,080
Scott: Like if I get a catalog, I go to the website of whoever sent the catalog and I'm like, don't send me this shit.

94
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,866
Scott: And it usually works.

95
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:48,100
Scott: Sometimes you get one more catalog, but usually it works.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,019
Rym: We got to pass a law that says you can never mail physical paper to anyone unless they sign a physical piece of paper multiple times saying they want it.

97
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:57,760
Scott: Post office to go have business.

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Rym: Post office just be funded by tax dollars and shouldn't have to raise any money.

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,126
Scott: Yes, but you can't do.

100
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:03,199
Scott: you can't do one without the other.

101
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:11,939
Rym: I mean, we could by just taxing the businesses ban spam and everyone who's been sending spam up to this point who is not a politician, tax them.

102
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:14,340
Scott: Anyway.

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,180
Rym: Anyway, so in some news, this is not anime convention news, but it's convention news because, you know, Otakon is happening.

104
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:27,460
Rym: And now Pax West officially in September, way after Otakon is also happening in person.

105
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,620
Scott: And yeah, well, this is this is not a lot of things.

106
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:39,240
Rym: This is we have been to every single Pax in the United States with no exceptions starting in 2008.

107
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,139
Scott: Like it's Pax has been up and we went to Australia once or twice.

108
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:47,116
Rym: GeekNights appeared at two Pax Australia's.

109
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:54,100
Rym: But for the first time, we're going to skip a Pax because this Pax is happening too soon.

110
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:04,420
Rym: They are having mask like very strict mask requirements, proof of vaccination or testing, social distancing within the convention center.

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,300
Rym: Like people have to stay six feet apart from each other and extremely limited capacity, which means like one.

112
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:13,460
Rym: How do you even have tabletop if you've got to stay six feet away from people?

113
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,179
Scott: Like how do you even have a like what's even going to be at the Pax?

114
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,740
Rym: It seems like it will just be an expo hall and panels and nothing else.

115
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,837
Scott: They haven't really said what it's going to be.

116
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:23,060
Scott: Right.

117
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,503
Scott: But I have.

118
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,059
Scott: they haven't opened multiple buildings.

119
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:33,240
Scott: You're going to like, you know, they're going to do this, you know, security theater, the usual security theater, but also some like temperature check security.

120
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,548
Rym: The thing is, it's funny, like.

121
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,060
Rym: I am not opposed to things that make sense.

122
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,799
Rym: Like I the metal detectors at conventions are just stupid, like they should go away.

123
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,900
Rym: Metal detectors at airports make sense, but the TSA screening does not make sense.

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,300
Rym: Like there's obviously nuances there.

125
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,865
Scott: I'm pretty cool.

126
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,093
Scott: It's not the security part.

127
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,180
Scott: It's the theater part.

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,020
Rym: But like the temperature check at the door, I'd be cool with all public venues not letting anyone in who has a high temperature.

129
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:10,200
Scott: Except the temperature check is heavily flawed and those devices that they use, the ones that shoot from far away are not so great.

130
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,887
Rym: You'd have to have a secondary check.

131
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,880
Rym: Obviously, it'd have to be done in a common sense way.

132
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,940
Scott: But anyway, it's all saying like the temperature check is is basically theater, right?

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,942
Scott: It's like it doesn't.

134
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:23,791
Scott: and even if someone doesn't have if you're trying if your goal is only to prevent the spread of covid, it's like.

135
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:28,179
Rym: actually the temperature checks are fairly effective in a lot of non-U.S.

136
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,480
Rym: places.

137
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,380
Rym: They've been commonplace for decades in like Asian countries with significant success at preventing outbreaks locally.

138
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,285
Scott: Because that's not what I've been reading.

139
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:40,220
Scott: I've been reading that it's basically doesn't really help at all.

140
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
Scott: It just makes people feel safer the same way that airport security does.

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,080
Rym: I mean, it depends a lot on how it's implemented.

142
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Rym: Like I was the one time I was flying back to, I think, Singapore and the distance center flagged me.

143
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:59,059
Rym: So I had to go aside and they did like two different devices, like real temperature checks and grilled me where I'd been before they let me go.

144
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:12,900
Rym: Anyway, that's all moot because the problem is PACS should not be happening if they need all these measures, because as long as these measures are required, there shouldn't be large mass conventions like this full stop.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,160
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:23,220
Scott: And at the PACS, you know, we said this on our last minute moment, right, is, you know, I said the same thing that I said there, which is like, I'm not getting on an airplane if you make me wear a parachute the whole time.

147
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,246
Scott: Because it's like I'd rather just stay home.

148
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:25,507
Scott: Right.

149
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,314
Scott: It's like I'm not saying it's unsafe.

150
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:28,980
Scott: I'm saying I'll just not going to do that.

151
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:38,560
Scott: It's like if it's not safe enough to not wear have to wear a parachute the whole flight, then that tells me that you think that there is something unsafe about the plane.

152
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:54,260
Scott: Even if I'm going to live with the parachute, you know, even if the mask and the vaccine is going to keep me safe, the fact that you're saying it's not safe enough to just go with no restrictions, just having a ball like a usual PACS, I'll just stay home and wait for a safe PACS.

153
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,262
Scott: I heavily encourage you.

154
00:09:56,282 --> 00:10:01,887
Scott: I posted that opinion in the PACS Reddit and I was the most upvoted comment.

155
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:13,780
Scott: So it shows, I think, while I have seen some people in comment threads around PACS communities online, you know, showing enthusiasm like hooray, PACS, finally, yes.

156
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,100
Scott: Right.

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,947
Scott: I think the majority, it feels like the majority of people.

158
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:23,000
Rym: There might be a silent majority that was just not weighing in or not following cons because they weren't planning to go to any.

159
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,001
Scott: Yeah.

160
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,186
Scott: I think that, you know, I mean, even in a normal time, normal-ish time, right?

161
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,348
Scott: No such thing as a normal time.

162
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:34,714
Scott: But the majority of the PACS community is silent online until the time comes.

163
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,114
Scott: Right.

164
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,236
Scott: It's like until the last second.

165
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,838
Scott: And then they go away.

166
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:38,078
Scott: Right.

167
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,860
Scott: It's a very brief, you know, spike.

168
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:40,521
Rym: Right.

169
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,108
Rym: But I highly encourage you do not go to fan conventions anytime soon.

170
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,974
Scott: I would not encourage, I would not encourage anyone to go.

171
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:52,439
Scott: But, you know, with you, it's your choice to go.

172
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,200
Scott: I'm not going.

173
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,560
Scott: Yep.

174
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:54,582
Rym: We are not going.

175
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:55,463
Rym: We're not presenting.

176
00:10:55,583 --> 00:11:07,458
Rym: And our official full policy is we will not attend any convention that requires masks, social distancing or capacity limits beyond what the venue has required for like fire code.

177
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:08,680
Rym: Like that's our line.

178
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,761
Scott: I mean, I don't need to get that specific.

179
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:18,207
Scott: I can just be like, hey, if they, if they feel it's necessary to take extra precautions because, you know, a beyond normal, right.

180
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:24,771
Scott: Beyond the precautions that were taken in the before times, uh, then that means that they feel there is an increased danger.

181
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,533
Scott: And if there's increased danger, I'll just stay home.

182
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:28,294
Rym: Here's my line.

183
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:34,919
Scott: When they feel the convention is a safe enough to hold using the same safety measures they did in 2018, 2019, then I'll, then I'll go.

184
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:45,233
Rym: If the sole measure was that theory, the definitely theater, quote, increase sanitation, I would probably just ignore that and go to a con.

185
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,320
Rym: But requiring masks, requiring social distancing, those are the big ones.

186
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,382
Scott: The final PAX East.

187
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:52,765
Scott: It's like they were just cleaning everything.

188
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:53,306
Scott: And you know what?

189
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,409
Scott: That actually matter.

190
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,812
Scott: It didn't matter.

191
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,756
Rym: I'm still like that.

192
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,560
Rym: That packs really squeaked in under the line.

193
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,581
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:09,513
Scott: Uh, but you know, there is something, I guess for another show to talk about is just, you know, forget, you know, this specific, you know, deadly plague, right?

195
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:13,780
Scott: It's like, there's always, you know, we've had packs is in the past with the swine flu.

196
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:14,641
Scott: Right.

197
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,066
Scott: And which is, I guess, not as deadly as COVID, but real kind of real bad.

198
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:22,230
Scott: And we've also had, there's always been packs box, right?

199
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:27,977
Scott: It's like, you know, we should maybe do something to, you know, increase.

200
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,220
Scott: I'm not saying any, you know, these sort of draconian.

201
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,501
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:36,820
Rym: Did not like wearing masks for the rest of our lives when we're not personally sick, not like social distancing forever.

203
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,380
Scott: Right.

204
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,673
Scott: But, you know, we should maybe, you know, do do more to prevent the spread of the, you know, packs box.

205
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,660
Scott: It just not just conventions, all large gatherings of humans.

206
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:57,095
Scott: I have humans gathered, even if it's like, oh, no pandemics or, you know, epidemics happening right now, but there's going to be a large gathering of humans at like this arena concert.

207
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:58,597
Scott: Maybe you should do something.

208
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:58,998
Scott: Right.

209
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,299
Scott: You know, at least think about it.

210
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:13,351
Rym: So but what my anecdote is, I've gotten sick at conventions and large events, like noticeably, significantly less often since I started doing one thing.

211
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:18,015
Rym: And that is not not with strangers, not touching people.

212
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,076
Rym: Like I'll only touch people.

213
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:20,217
Rym: I'm already touching.

214
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:23,240
Rym: And no, but like I won't shake hands with anybody when I go to conventions.

215
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,281
Scott: Or touch.

216
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:26,243
Scott: If I touch someone's hand, I wash my hands.

217
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,245
Rym: But I pretty much just avoid touching people's hands.

218
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:33,992
Rym: And like my packs, poxes reduced by like 50 to 100 percent.

219
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:34,813
Rym: Like it was ridiculous.

220
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,135
Scott: It's been a long time since I've had any kind of pox.

221
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,359
Rym: Though I did get a bad cold after that last paxies.

222
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,620
Scott: Oh, I didn't.

223
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,480
Rym: Anyway, so in some other news, there's some Gundam.

224
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,201
Scott: Yeah.

225
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:53,066
Scott: So Netflix has been making this Gundam Hathaway thing.

226
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,569
Scott: If you don't know Gundam story.

227
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:55,929
Scott: Right.

228
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:00,293
Scott: There's Bright Noah, who was the captain of the white ship in the original Gundam.

229
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:00,534
Scott: Right.

230
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,756
Scott: And his kid is Hathaway.

231
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:06,040
Scott: So this is like Hathaway growing up Gundam.

232
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,460
Scott: Right.

233
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,886
Scott: So it takes place like, you know, after all the it's in the same original Gundam, you know, you see.

234
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:14,286
Scott: Right.

235
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:15,688
Scott: Whatever.

236
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,771
Scott: But it's further in the future, but a little bit right after.

237
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,192
Scott: Right.

238
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,933
Scott: So it's been hyped.

239
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:22,654
Scott: It's been coming.

240
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,976
Scott: I think it's going to be out July something.

241
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,258
Scott: I don't know exactly which day in July.

242
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,160
Scott: You can set Netflix to give you a reminder.

243
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,176
Rym: Netflix says June.

244
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,881
Scott: I think it's been delayed.

245
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:33,202
Scott: I don't know.

246
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:36,164
Scott: Anyway, it's not out right now in June.

247
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,225
Scott: Twenty third is the point.

248
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:38,166
Scott: And it was.

249
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:39,447
Scott: it was delayed there.

250
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:43,030
Scott: If you look in the news, like old news, you'll see news like Hathaway delayed.

251
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:53,880
Scott: But anyway, I think to get people hyped and ready and also to accompany it, they have put on Netflix the original three Gundam compilation movie.

252
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,109
Scott: So the original Mobile Suit Gundam TV series was 80 episodes long and I've watched it.

253
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:05,637
Scott: But, you know, I think for most people watching all 80 episodes is probably not the best thing to do.

254
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:07,740
Scott: A lot of those episodes are just robot of the week.

255
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:09,284
Rym: Oh, no, I was wrong.

256
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,273
Rym: The the thing you're talking about, the collection came in June.

257
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,276
Scott: Yes.

258
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:14,179
Scott: You can watch that right now.

259
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:14,299
Scott: Yep.

260
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,852
Scott: So there are compilation movies and usually I'm kind of mad on compilation movies in general, because it's like, you know, you're not getting the whole story.

261
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,635
Scott: They cut out so much stuff, right?

262
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,918
Scott: You're sort of unless you know the story already.

263
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,980
Scott: And then what's the point of it?

264
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:40,575
Scott: But I actually haven't watched these compilation movies, but every anime nerd I know, Gundam nerds I know, they almost unanimously say, listen, you actually should.

265
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:44,260
Scott: almost all people should just watch these three compilation movies.

266
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,344
Scott: And not watch 80 episodes of the original Gundam TV series.

267
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,866
Scott: It's just better.

268
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:49,868
Scott: It's just shorter.

269
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,390
Scott: It covers everything you need to know.

270
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,191
Scott: Right.

271
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:59,080
Scott: Just watch these three movies so you can watch three movies and get the entire story of the original Mobile Suit Gundam.

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,028
Scott: I think the only better option than that would be to read the entire manga, which I have, but would be hard.

273
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,572
Scott: I don't know if that's available digitally or not.

274
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:15,221
Scott: And also, so after the original Mobile Suit Gundam, there's Zeta Gundam, which you can or can't watch.

275
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,903
Scott: It's up to you, in my opinion.

276
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:18,464
Scott: It's long.

277
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:19,125
Scott: I've seen it.

278
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,245
Scott: It's 50 episodes.

279
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:25,109
Scott: It really kind of meanders and drools and, you know, such and such.

280
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,390
Scott: It does have a plot.

281
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:35,537
Scott: It starts out with actually these other characters, like new characters, but then it switches back to the characters you care about, like Char and Amurore and whatever, right?

282
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,559
Scott: It's like, oh, no one cares about this show.

283
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,800
Scott: We better go back to the characters.

284
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,645
Rym: I see also Gundam Seed, various Tenchi spinoffs.

285
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:44,548
Scott: Yeah.

286
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:49,535
Scott: And then after that is Double Zeta Gundam, which doesn't have the characters.

287
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,340
Scott: It has some of the characters you care about, but it doesn't have Char or Amurore.

288
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,710
Rym: I've actually never seen any Double Zeta.

289
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,573
Scott: You don't need to.

290
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:57,557
Rym: It's not a moment of it.

291
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:58,120
Rym: Good to know.

292
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,722
Scott: I've never seen it either.

293
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,746
Scott: And everyone says it's garbage that I've heard, right?

294
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:08,132
Scott: But anyway, and then after that is Char's Counterattack.

295
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:14,020
Scott: So you don't need, in my opinion, you don't really need to, even though technically Char's Counterattack comes after Double Zeta.

296
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,007
Scott: I don't think you need to watch Zeta and Double Zeta.

297
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:22,260
Scott: I think you can watch these three movies and then watch Char's Counterattack, which is also on Netflix now.

298
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,884
Scott: There are compilation movies for Zeta Gundam.

299
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,527
Scott: I guess you could watch those if you really wanted to.

300
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:32,851
Scott: Maybe that's a good idea if you just end up really liking it, right?

301
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:34,814
Scott: And you want to get a little bit more full story.

302
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:39,760
Scott: I don't know if they're good or not because I watched the whole 50 episodes of Zeta Gundam.

303
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,023
Scott: But yeah, it's like now.

304
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:49,835
Scott: Gundam is somewhat more accessible to the people and there's going to be new original universe Gundam.

305
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,300
Scott: So this is kind of exciting Gundam times here.

306
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:02,019
Rym: Yeah, maybe it is Gundam time because I was having a weird urge to watch Gundam Seed again because I randomly, like some playlist I was listening to, played one of the openings from that show and I was just like, "All right, Gundam

307
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:02,420
Rym: Seed.".

308
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:04,760
Scott: I mean, have you watched the original Gundam?

309
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:12,658
Rym: No, I watched like 15 episodes of it and then I got bored and I watched the first compilation movie years ago.

310
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,420
Rym: I never watched the other ones.

311
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,853
Scott: All right, well we got these movies on Netflix.

312
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,519
Scott: Let's see some good ones.

313
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,819
Rym: Let's watch Ob Taxi first because I feel like we're going to talk about that.

314
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,947
Scott: Yeah, I'm definitely watching that.

315
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,820
Scott: I've been wanting to watch that for a while.

316
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,540
Rym: Multiple people have said Animal Fight Club and won't say anything else, so we'll see.

317
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:27,479
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

318
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:34,440
Rym: So yeah, in some other news, Tuka and Birdie, as you recall, basically got cancelled, got saved.

319
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,960
Scott: All I know is that it was a show that was on TV that people liked and then it was cancelled.

320
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:44,772
Rym: It was a phenomenal show and there was nothing else like it.

321
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:48,780
Rym: It was very non-male, like it was not a male perspective.

322
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:56,160
Rym: It was very diverse, set in New York City, very millennial in terms of like the problems people face and like social troubles.

323
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,160
Rym: And it was also very- Can't afford the rent.

324
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,000
Rym: Yeah, and it's very like, it takes absurd situations to animal people, kind of like the Bojack Horseman thing.

325
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:13,620
Rym: But what it's about are the very real and serious problems that our generation has faced and it addresses them directly, bluntly, and elegantly.

326
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,917
Rym: Like it's a fantastic show.

327
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,580
Rym: So of course it got cancelled, like it was too good, and it got saved.

328
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:30,420
Rym: So not only is season two now airing, but the first episode of season two, and this seems to be a trend with Adult Swim, because they did the same thing for the new season of Rick and Morty.

329
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,057
Rym: The first episode is free, legally on YouTube, just watch the whole thing.

330
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:34,560
Rym: It's just there.

331
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,260
Scott: That's how you do these days.

332
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,240
Rym: That is how you do these days.

333
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,000
Rym: So having watched that first episode, one, if you haven't watched the original Tuka and Birdie, just go watch it.

334
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,014
Rym: It is literally, it is a top tier show.

335
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,360
Rym: I think everyone should watch.

336
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,620
Rym: Season two is exactly that same energy, it's just as good, it picks right up.

337
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,100
Rym: There is no loss of creativity, no loss of talent, no loss of energy.

338
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,559
Scott: Is it the same people working on it?

339
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,400
Rym: Same people, same characters, like it might as well, this episode might as well have just come out.

340
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,580
Scott: So they just bought the show.

341
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,660
Rym: Yeah, they just saved the show.

342
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,260
Rym: Nothing was broken, changed, or ruined about the show.

343
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:16,020
Scott: Because sometimes people will buy the license and rescue a thing, but not actually, and then try to make it, but they didn't actually.

344
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,619
Rym: This is pretty much just more Tuka and Birdie, and I highly recommend it.

345
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:35,620
Rym: In a little bit of news, we can't talk about it much, because there's not much to talk about, but Uzumaki is getting an anime that is very much in a black and white, minimal animation, interesting style.

346
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:41,100
Rym: And we have several seconds of a teaser trailer, and that's basically it.

347
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,999
Scott: Yeah, and behind there was that Junji Ito collection anime, and that was a little bit disappointing, right?

348
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:57,040
Rym: At least Yamishibai is super limited animation on purpose, and also it's super short, those episodes.

349
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,839
Rym: It's more like someone telling you a campfire ghost story.

350
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:01,328
Rym: So we'll see.

351
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,560
Rym: I'm excited about this.

352
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,800
Scott: Hopefully Uzumaki has a little bit more money behind it.

353
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
Scott: And also, the Junji Ito collection was like an anthology, right?

354
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,000
Scott: It was like all these little one-offs.

355
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:17,199
Scott: This is like a full continuing serial, so I think that might, maybe there'll be more stuff behind it.

356
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,239
Rym: So it looks like there's more info than when we first looked at it.

357
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,000
Rym: It's going to be a four-episode mini-series in partnership with Studio IG, or Production IG.

358
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,760
Scott: Okay, so there's going to be more production value behind it.

359
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,719
Rym: Yeah, so I'm cautiously optimistic about this.

360
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:42,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it is a continuing serial manga, as opposed to a little one-off short story, but it is only a few volumes long, so I was wondering how much material.

361
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Scott: But yeah, you said four episodes, that makes sense, right?

362
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:49,700
Rym: And one last little thing, you might remember way back, Anime News Nina kind of ended.

363
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,280
Rym: We've talked about Anime News Nina.

364
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,299
Scott: That was way back.

365
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,781
Scott: Yeah,

366
00:21:53,042 --> 00:22:10,058
Rym: we talked about it moderately often on the show, because the point you need to remember about it is that Anime News Network had this comic, and it was funny in a very real and direct way that you would not expect from the official comic of an outfit, a really A-B outfit.

367
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
Scott: Well, no, that used to be like a common thing, right?

368
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,860
Scott: It's like Nintendo Power had the comic in the bag.

369
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,009
Rym: The Nintendo Power comic was not real.

370
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:20,440
Rym: It was not hard-hitting in any way.

371
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,760
Rym: It would not make the kinds of jokes I would want as a Nintendo fan.

372
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,176
Scott: It wouldn't make fun of Nintendo ever.

373
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:33,659
Scott: Having a comic in the back of the journalistic publication, right?

374
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,579
Scott: No, that's relatively normal.

375
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,445
Scott: Yeah, that was a thing.

376
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:41,700
Scott: But with websites, that wasn't really a thing, right?

377
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,540
Scott: Journalistic websites don't really have... I'm not talking about running the funny pages.

378
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,720
Scott: I'm talking about you have your own comic that is part of your magazine, even if your magazine is a website.

379
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:59,880
Scott: So, Anime News Network doing that I thought was always cool and a throwback to things like Nintendo Power, Nestor, and whatever.

380
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:11,959
Rym: But the difference was, Anime News Nina would make the dark, real-talk jokes about the realities of American anime fans, and it went to places I never expected it to go.

381
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:22,520
Rym: So, it looks like it has revived with Intern Annika, and there's a bunch of comics here, and the tradition continues.

382
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:23,780
Rym: Good.

383
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,610
Rym: Go check it out.

384
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,387
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

385
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:34,810
Rym: What do you got?

386
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,573
Scott: What do I have?

387
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:39,610
Scott: Oh, so I've always had this idea, I guess, since college, right?

388
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,530
Scott: I just thought of it, but I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of it, right?

389
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,849
Scott: Because it's such an obvious and also dumb idea.

390
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,170
Scott: To have a computer just generate every photo ever, right?

391
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,075
Scott: It's possible, right?

392
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,403
Rym: Every melody that's possible with the Western notation system.

393
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,350
Rym: that was a certain length or less.

394
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:03,510
Scott: Sure, right.

395
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,000
Scott: You could be like, "Okay, we'll pick 100 by 100 pixels or 200 by 200," and you have 32-bit color, right?

396
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,046
Scott: So, it's like, "Well, how many colors times how many pixels equals how many possible

397
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:14,528
Scott: images?".

398
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,804
Scott: And it's like, "That's enough to

399
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:17,006
Scott: have.".

400
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,669
Scott: It's like, "Yeah, most of them are just going to be static and noise," right?

401
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:24,310
Scott: As you iterate or randomly go through every possibility.

402
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:29,190
Scott: But, you know, in there somewhere is every person naked, right?

403
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,850
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's every photo of everything, every building ever.

404
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,709
Scott: Every building that doesn't even exist yet.

405
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,430
Scott: Video, you know, every character from everything ever and every pose ever, right?

406
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:52,010
Scott: It's like, you know, the problem is, is to generate all those images would take more time and storage space than there are, like, you know, particles in the universe.

407
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:59,770
Scott: So, as if you keep your problem space small, it becomes possible, right?

408
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,929
Scott: I want to generate every black and white image.

409
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,030
Scott: I suddenly cut down the colors, right?

410
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,370
Scott: That's two by two pixels where the 16 such images.

411
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,867
Scott: All 16 images, there they are, right?

412
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:11,370
Scott: Congrats.

413
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,550
Scott: You know, I want to generate every one pixel image in black or white.

414
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,110
Scott: It's like, congrats, there's two of them, the black one and the white one, right?

415
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:29,010
Scott: But here, somebody took that idea and in a really interesting fashion, right?

416
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:37,330
Scott: They've managed to keep the problem space small enough to be feasible, but constrained enough where all the images are interesting.

417
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,550
Scott: What they're doing is not limiting the number of colors, right?

418
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,250
Scott: What they're doing is limiting the basically, like, you must use every color once, right?

419
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:51,602
Scott: Every single, right, you know, it's 255 times 255 times 255, right?

420
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,830
Scott: Because RGB, right, is 16.7 million colors or whatever.

421
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:05,290
Scott: So, it's like, make an image that's 16.7 million pixels and has every color in exactly one pixel.

422
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:11,770
Scott: And most of those images are just going to be like a, you know, like a white noise kind of thing or some kind of pink noise or something.

423
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,290
Rym: But I see scrolling down, I see the Mona Lisa, I see the Nevermind album cover.

424
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:18,274
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

425
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:22,090
Scott: It's like, you know, every, you can only use each color one time, right?

426
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,809
Scott: But you've got a lot of similar colors, you can group them together at least.

427
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:39,870
Scott: And yeah, this website, All RGB, attempts to create a database that has, I guess, eventually every image that consists of all RGB colors in that space, exactly one color per pixel.

428
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:44,145
Scott: And there's a lot of fascinating images there and there's, you know, more all the time.

429
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,390
Scott: I presume they don't have them all yet.

430
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:49,690
Rym: So, I was just thinking, these are probably really hard to compress.

431
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,326
Rym: And as I'm scrolling through, yep, these are like 50, 60 megabyte images.

432
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:55,116
Scott: Oh yeah, yeah.

433
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:57,530
Scott: But it's still really cool.

434
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,649
Rym: Yeah, this is super cool.

435
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:07,750
Scott: I mean, my idea of doing like every black and white, you know, 16 color image that is, you know, that's a small size, I would have had way less interesting images than this.

436
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:16,350
Rym: So, I decided, because I have a huge backlog of fun things of the day, so I decided that I would force myself to pick one that was also related to colors.

437
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:35,970
Rym: So, in Super Mario 2, the remake of Doki Doki Panic in the United States, if you look at the characters, like the sprites, everyone but Toad, there are too many colors in those sprites to be represented by sprites in the Nintendo Entertainment System.

438
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:38,033
Rym: There's one too many colors.

439
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:48,290
Rym: There's no way for Mario to have red, that fleshy color, the blue, and transparency, because one of the colors is always transparency, and white.

440
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:57,490
Rym: So, this video, which is not that long, explains what they did, and the fascinating part about this is how fucking unnecessary this was.

441
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,302
Rym: It was solely for style points and nothing else.

442
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,510
Rym: Doki Doki Panic did not do this.

443
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:11,202
Rym: They just used four colors in the sprites, and Nintendo was like, "Well, for Super Mario 2, we really want that fifth color.

444
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,287
Rym: Do ridiculous bullshit to make that fifth color

445
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:14,668
Rym: appear.".

446
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:16,330
Scott: Okay.

447
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,762
Rym: Do you know, like, the deal?

448
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:18,005
Rym: Like, why?

449
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,090
Scott: I watched the video a while ago, but I forget because it was ridiculous bullshit.

450
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:35,290
Rym: I won't say the deal, but the hint, and I remember this from when I was a kid, the hint that will tell you what's going on is when you open doors and do certain things in the game, the character's eyes will flash.

451
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:45,230
Rym: They'll, like, flicker at a steady rate whenever that happens, and only whenever that happens, and that shouldn't be enough of a clue to figure out what they did, but if you don't care, just watch this video.

452
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,110
Rym: This video is not, like, the gay, like, the NES video.

453
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,029
Scott: I feel like we've used this channel for things of the day several times.

454
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,145
Rym: I have not used Retro Game Mechanics Explained.

455
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:54,970
Rym: There's a different channel.

456
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,889
Scott: I feel like I have definitely used it before.

457
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,731
Rym: You might have.

458
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:04,168
Rym: Typically, I link to, like, 40 or 50 minute long videos that get way deep into what the Nintendo is doing.

459
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:06,543
Scott: This one- This channel does that also.

460
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:07,369
Scott: They do long ones.

461
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:13,610
Rym: But this video in particular is super accessible if you know nothing about programming or the Nintendo Entertainment System.

462
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,980
Scott: Yeah, that's a really good channel, though, in general.

463
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:18,490
Scott: That's why we're in multiple things of the day.

464
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:19,032
Scott: Yep.

465
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:25,390
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, which I am reading, The Tale of Genji, that motherfucker.

466
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:35,507
Rym: How many times is there a scene where he- someone is trying to tell him something, and he just doesn't give a shit, but as soon as they mention something scandalous, he suddenly wakes up.

467
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,330
Rym: Like, he suddenly perks up and gets real interested.

468
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,504
Scott: Yeah, all he cares about, you know, he's ladies gossip, right?

469
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:41,710
Scott: He's not a good person.

470
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,217
Rym: Nah.

471
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:45,700
Scott: He's the titular character.

472
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,688
Scott: Doesn't have to be, like, a hero or a good guy.

473
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:48,894
Scott: He's just like- He's just a guy.

474
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,102
Rym: He's a guy.

475
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:51,309
Rym: Walking around, looking around.

476
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:54,363
Scott: Making mischief.

477
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,169
Rym: I feel like walking around, looking around, occasionally making trouble is kind of the entire tale of Genji so far.

478
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,697
Scott: He's like just this really self-interested dude, right?

479
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:13,310
Scott: Who, you know, sometimes cares or pretends to care, sometimes doesn't, but gets away with a lot of shit because he's good looking and talented.

480
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:13,811
Scott: Yep.

481
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:15,337
Rym: Kind of like real life.

482
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,330
Rym: You can get away with a lot if you're good looking and talented, unfortunately.

483
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:19,438
Scott: Yep.

484
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:34,168
Rym: Otherwise, as we talked about before, we will not be live at PAX West 2021, but we will be live on Saturday, July 17th at 1.45 PM Eastern Time in the PAX2 Twitch stream with Atari game design.

485
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:35,730
Rym: It's all new content.

486
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:37,926
Rym: Yep, PAX East Online.

487
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:38,310
Rym: Totally.

488
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:41,643
Scott: Yeah, PAX West is gonna be IRL and we're gonna be AWOL.

489
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:43,796
Scott: Yep.

490
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,930
Scott: And PAX East is gonna be digital, so we'll be there.

491
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:53,344
Rym: We might be doing something during PAX West that does not involve PAX West, but I'm not gonna say anything about that.

492
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,970
Rym: so no one can yell at me for not doing it if we don't do it.

493
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:58,523
Scott: And that's got nothing to do with anyone who's listening to this.

494
00:30:58,543 --> 00:30:59,449
Scott: I don't even know why you're doing it up.

495
00:30:59,690 --> 00:30:59,872
Scott: Nope.

496
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,870
Rym: Well, because things will come out of it, possibly.

497
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:03,287
Scott: That's their problem.

498
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,456
Rym: If we do the, well anyway, I'm not gonna speak to that.

499
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,641
Rym: What else is going on?

500
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,989
Rym: We can't really go anywhere yet, so...

501
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:12,570
Scott: Nope.

502
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,695
Scott: You should find us, you know, we're on the internet.

503
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:26,510
Scott: You somehow found this podcast, I assume if you're listening, 99% chance you already know, but in case you're somehow a brand new listener, our podcasts are available on like every fucking platform.

504
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:33,281
Scott: We have community on every platform, you know, we got the Twitters, we even, you know, we got the everything, right?

505
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:37,769
Scott: We got a forum, we got Discord, we got like every freaking place that's on the internet.

506
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:38,430
Scott: We're there somewhere.

507
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,187
Rym: I also realized something funny.

508
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:39,700
Rym: YouTube.

509
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,739
Rym: Despite the fact that GeekNights is four different nights, we started around the same time as Anime World Order.

510
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,162
Rym: In fact, they started a little bit before us.

511
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:51,510
Rym: We've done more Wednesday episodes than they have done episodes.

512
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,870
Scott: Why are you making fun of other podcasts?

513
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,850
Rym: Because I just realized that recently, out of nowhere.

514
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,830
Scott: Yeah, but one of their anime episodes is as good as like ten of ours.

515
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,733
Scott: It is like three hours.

516
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:04,310
Rym: They basically review three shows, or three comics, every time they do a show.

517
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:06,609
Scott: And actually know what they're talking about.

518
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,100
Scott: Nah.

519
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,889
Scott: That's already, that's like times nine.

520
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,781
Rym: We also cheat by talking about non-anime and like other cartoons.

521
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:13,850
Rym: Like Wednesdays are not anime days, they're just cartoon days.

522
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:14,881
Scott: Sure.

523
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:24,760
Rym: But we've been podcasting since 2005, and if you somehow enjoy this, we don't, like a lot of podcasts charge money for their archives.

524
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:26,082
Rym: We don't.

525
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,143
Rym: They're all just there.

526
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:27,864
Rym: Every one.

527
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,606
Rym: All the way back to 2005.

528
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:32,429
Rym: If you're desperate to listen to us have very 2005 opinions.

529
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,450
Scott: That I don't agree with anymore.

530
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:36,870
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,272
Scott: So, Batman.

532
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:46,879
Rym: We've talked about, I realize we've only talked about Batman, like at length, twice on GeekNights.

533
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:56,250
Rym: In 2007, we reviewed Batman the Dark Knight Returns, which regardless of your opinions on the author of that work, I think it's still a stand-up Batman work.

534
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,050
Scott: Probably one of the best Batman comics.

535
00:32:59,812 --> 00:32:59,872
Rym: Yep.

536
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:03,370
Rym: And we talked about B-TAS, Batman the Animated Series, last year.

537
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:06,249
Scott: The best Batman, that's still the best Batman thing there is.

538
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,785
Rym: I think that is the best Batman thing there is, but what we want to do tonight is just talk about Batman as a concept.

539
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,830
Rym: The entire oeuvre of Batman.

540
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,796
Scott: Right, well we did a Spider-Man show, so we might as well do a Batman show.

541
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:20,159
Scott: Even it out.

542
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,686
Scott: Get the fair shake and the Marvel vs.

543
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:25,650
Scott: DC biz going on.

544
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,670
Rym: Batman is honestly kind of the only DC thing I've liked consistently at any point in my life.

545
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:37,850
Scott: It's weird because sometimes I like Batman a lot and sometimes I just don't give a shit.

546
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:47,370
Rym: Yeah, well it's interesting because when Batman is in other shows, like when Batman is hanging out with Justice League, whatever kind of stuff, it's never interesting.

547
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,017
Rym: Most Batman things I actually don't like.

548
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:54,950
Rym: Most of the live-action Batman movies I deeply disliked.

549
00:33:55,852 --> 00:34:04,090
Rym: I actually really, I'm not even joking, I legitimately like the Michael Vakitan live-action Batmans kind of the most of any live-action Batman.

550
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,230
Scott: The 1989 one's the best live-action one still.

551
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,719
Scott: Yeah, because it was weird.

552
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:09,590
Rym: In a good way.

553
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:22,210
Scott: No, but yeah, I think that every, all of the big time underwear pervert superheroes, Marvel or DC, who have been around for a long time and have been very popular, right?

554
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:26,650
Scott: And have had their stories adapted into different mediums, right?

555
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,650
Scott: They've all taken, all the characters individually have taken on different, there's different takes on them, right?

556
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:41,770
Scott: It's like even, you know, it's like we talk about Spider-Man, it's like you know how many different takes there are on Spider-Man, there's like happy-go-lucky Spider-Man, right?

557
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,750
Scott: There's different people are Spider-Man, it's not always Peter Parker, right?

558
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,809
Rym: I mean we were just talking about Spider-Man 2099 where he's a cyberpunk anti-hero.

559
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:58,570
Scott: Right, but even if you just only look at Peter Parker's Spider-Man, it's like, you know, there's jerky Peter Parker's Spider-Man, having a fun time, you know, sad Peter Parker's Spider-Man, right?

560
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,152
Scott: There's so many different takes on it, right?

561
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:12,710
Scott: But I think of all of the major characters, Batman has like the most varied takes over time and also the most varied takes simultaneously.

562
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:23,850
Rym: Yeah, like right now there's some other Batman going on, there's a live-action Batman movie coming and like Batman is a big part of Harley Quinn, like Batman's the Wolverine of the DC Universe.

563
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:30,330
Scott: Right, well I mean even if you look at Wolverine, it's like okay at one point Wolverine was doing this, at another point he was doing that.

564
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,902
Rym: But he's always kind of the same, just doing different things.

565
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,530
Rym: Batman is a different Batman.

566
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,465
Scott: You can look at Batman at any point in, you know, I mean originally Batman was just Detective E, right?

567
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,210
Scott: Even had a gun and shit at the start, right?

568
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:47,210
Scott: Then there was the campy Adam West style, which the comics were also doing in the Silver Age, right?

569
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,949
Rym: Which I do like.

570
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,781
Scott: Yeah, and then after the Silver Age, right?

571
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:54,610
Scott: You get into the Neil Adams and the Frank Miller Batman.

572
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,107
Scott: And then, you know, late 80s, suddenly then is when B-TAS comes around, 90s.

573
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,190
Scott: You know, by then you've got all the different Batmans going on at once, right?

574
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:06,968
Scott: You know, Super Friends Batman was actually before then.

575
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:16,190
Scott: But yeah, it's like you can at any one time, right, go to a comic, you can go in like one day, you could like go to a comic book store.

576
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:25,250
Scott: And in the comic book store you could find like current Batman things and like one's a gritty one, like one's got like, you know, like R-rated shit in it.

577
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,910
Scott: One's like for kids having a good time, one's real campy, right?

578
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:34,410
Scott: And then you can go watch Batman on TV and get a different take at the same time.

579
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,170
Scott: And then you can go to a movie theater and get yet another take all in like the same fucking day, right?

580
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,830
Scott: And you go to the toy store and you can see like two lines of toys that are different, right?

581
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:50,850
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like it's one character at the core, but it's actually like several.

582
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:59,610
Scott: Like they're using the character to appeal to several different audiences simultaneously at all times, right?

583
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:07,110
Scott: It's like, let's get the, you know, we'll have this, you know, kids Batman, you know, uh, you know, uh, edgelord Batman.

584
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:10,770
Scott: They got every Batman going on at all times for everybody.

585
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:18,890
Rym: So in terms of like Batman films, because we can talk about Batman, if we can just sort of bucket this into like different areas of Batman.

586
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,508
Scott: Yeah, however you want to bucket it.

587
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:29,650
Rym: Yeah, let's start with films because, uh, honestly, like I'm literally the Michael Keaton 1989 Batman, I think is the best live action Batman film ever made.

588
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:30,931
Scott: Yep.

589
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:31,192
Scott: Same.

590
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:36,750
Scott: I mean, a lot of people love those newer ones, but I watched two of them, right?

591
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,685
Scott: I watched the Batman Begins one, right?

592
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:40,510
Scott: I didn't like that one.

593
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:46,110
Rym: I've watched a bunch of them and every one of them left me very dissatisfied.

594
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,357
Rym: I guess I've never, let's see, I've got a whole list here of films.

595
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,502
Scott: I never saw, apparently there was a 1943 Batman and a 1966 Batman that I never saw.

596
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,275
Scott: No, it wasn't the '66 one.

597
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:57,161
Scott: In the '66 one, the Adam West one.

598
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,001
Rym: '43 I never saw.

599
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:00,770
Rym: I did not know that was a thing.

600
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,001
Scott: I did not see the '40, I did not see that one though.

601
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:04,690
Scott: But the Adam West one's the '66 one, right?

602
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,670
Scott: Oh, it's a 15 chapter theatrical serial.

603
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:10,522
Scott: Yeah, okay, there were a lot of serials back then.

604
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:11,730
Scott: There was a Captain America one also.

605
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,011
Rym: Yep.

606
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:21,410
Rym: So, 1966 and 1989 Batman were the first two live action Batman things I saw, which is basically the beginning, except for these '40s serials.

607
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,154
Rym: And it's funny.

608
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:27,010
Rym: as a kid, I loved the shit out of the Batman movie, the Adam West one.

609
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:33,850
Rym: But, kind of like with Project Aco and anime and a lot of other things, I had no idea it was supposed to be funny as a kid.

610
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:41,350
Scott: No, when I was a kid, I would watch Adam West Batman on TV, and I didn't realize it was supposed to be, like, you know, stupid.

611
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:43,783
Rym: I was just like, "Oh shit, a bomb!

612
00:38:44,044 --> 00:38:44,508
Rym: What's he gonna

613
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:44,608
Rym: do?".

614
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:50,669
Scott: Right, I was like, I was watching it like it was real, you know.

615
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:57,850
Scott: And now I know better, so it doesn't really hold up for me, but it holds up in a nostalgia way, like as a piece of artwork.

616
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:04,410
Scott: But it's not a thing that I can watch and enjoy and care about sincerely, right?

617
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:07,587
Scott: It's more like a cool painting to put on the wall.

618
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,090
Scott: that's kitschy.

619
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:15,030
Rym: Yep, but I remember this moment when 1989 Batman came out, my dad went to see it in the theater to figure out if it was suitable for us kids to see.

620
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:21,250
Rym: Because I was 1989, and he came home, and I just remember- I think we just went to see it, I don't remember.

621
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:26,828
Rym: But I remember, we didn't end up seeing it, of course, but I remember the conversation was roughly along the lines of, "How was

622
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:26,948
Rym: it?".

623
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,441
Rym: My dad's like, "It was

624
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:28,866
Rym: dark.".

625
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,528
Rym: And my mom's like, "Oh, like too dark for the

626
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:32,770
Rym: kids?".

627
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,680
Rym: And he's like, "No, it was so dark you couldn't see anything on the screen.

628
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:37,606
Rym: We gotta go to a better

629
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:37,907
Rym: theater.".

630
00:39:39,871 --> 00:39:42,870
Rym: Because there was a crappy theater near us, and a better theater that was further away.

631
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:51,410
Rym: But I remember this was the movie that introduced me as a kid to the concept of nerve gas, which was terrifying to me as a kid.

632
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,270
Scott: I never really thought about that.

633
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:06,290
Rym: Like I never encountered the concept, like I knew the idea, you know kids know about things like quicksand and poison gas, but nerve gas and like that being Joker's thing was actually really scary to a kid.

634
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,870
Scott: Well, I guess to you, I never thought about it much.

635
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:19,910
Rym: But I really enjoyed it mostly because it had that like Tim Burton weird edge, like it felt like a weird larger than life comic movie.

636
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,550
Rym: And Michael Keaton I think did a pretty good job playing a Bruce Wayne Batman.

637
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:34,149
Rym: Like it didn't, I think a lot of people think that the Michael Keaton Batmans don't feel right because they're used to so much Batman media that it's just a big jaw going, "I'm

638
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:34,730
Rym: Batman!"

639
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:39,770
Rym: And punching people and kind of forget like Batman had a lot of different incarnations.

640
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,810
Rym: And Michael Keaton was the first time we saw a live action Batman that wasn't Adam West.

641
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,382
Scott: Right, well I mean I think that one also...

642
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,583
Rym: I imprinted on him like a baby duckling.

643
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:49,310
Rym: He's my Batman.

644
00:40:51,090 --> 00:41:00,530
Scott: I think that, you know, that 1989 one also sort of had that, you know, it didn't give Batman any actual supernatural or fantastical powers.

645
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,576
Rym: Not at all.

646
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,889
Rym: He just had equipment and money and resolve.

647
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:11,470
Scott: But it had, you know, it felt like, you know, it had sort of that same sort of magical element, right?

648
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,516
Scott: Like when he flies the friggin' Bat ship.

649
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:15,101
Scott: He's got like an airplane.

650
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,010
Scott: It's shaped like a bat which would never fly, obviously.

651
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:21,481
Scott: He eclipses the moon in E.T.

652
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,666
Scott: like fashion, right?

653
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:23,810
Scott: It's like, you know.

654
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:32,930
Rym: But it almost felt operatic or like a stage play in that there would be like the swelling music and then the Batmobile comes out of its hole.

655
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:43,748
Rym: Like there were so many just set piece scenes that put you in this mood that really no Batman movie since the second Michael Keaton Batman movie has ever really done.

656
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:44,590
Rym: well in my opinion.

657
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:50,350
Rym: I did really like Batman Returns as well.

658
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,578
Rym: I think, I don't know if I like, I'd have to watch them both again.

659
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,870
Rym: I haven't seen either one since I was in like high school.

660
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,738
Scott: You know, I mean, soon after that, you know, the '89 Batman, right?

661
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:05,590
Scott: There was the 1990 Dick Tracy that I think sort of had a lot in common with it.

662
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,478
Scott: Oh yeah!

663
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,387
Rym: That movie is underrated.

664
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,110
Scott: Even though that was not, you know, it was not Tim Burton, I think it carried, you know, a lot of the same aesthetic elements.

665
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:21,870
Rym: I saw a thing recently talking about how they got that aesthetic because color grading didn't really exist the way we have it today back then.

666
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,829
Rym: They made ridiculous sets to like film that thing, yeah.

667
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:33,807
Scott: But anyway, see, I guess Batman movies, I like, you know, even the second one, you know, Batman Returns.

668
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:35,030
Scott: I like that one, right?

669
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:43,390
Rym: Well, because I had these ideas of Catwoman and then Catwoman appears and Catwoman is weird and the Penguin was weird and it was funny.

670
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:48,110
Scott: Yeah, I didn't actually fully understand what was going on in that movie until I watched it again when I was older.

671
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,564
Rym: It was just like a bunch of scenes linked together and, "Oh, there's Penguin.

672
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:52,769
Rym: Alright, let's see what Penguin's

673
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:52,970
Rym: like.".

674
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,959
Scott: I was just like, "Okay, Batman is a good guy.

675
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:55,803
Scott: The other guys are bad guys.

676
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:56,647
Scott: I don't know what's going on

677
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:56,788
Scott: here.".

678
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,208
Scott: But the Jim Carrey Riddler one with Two-Face, right?

679
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:02,590
Scott: That one?

680
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,521
Rym: That was Batman and Robin?

681
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,405
Rym: Yeah, Batman and Robin.

682
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:07,430
Rym: Oh, Batman Forever.

683
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:08,502
Scott: Oh, Batman Forever?

684
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,070
Scott: Batman Forever.

685
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:11,310
Rym: That one I bounced off of hard.

686
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:20,410
Scott: I don't know if that one was, yeah, I don't think it was as good as those other two, but because of just the time I was born, right?

687
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:27,010
Scott: We saw it, like, probably, I've probably seen that one the most because it was on TV, like, constantly.

688
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:29,796
Scott: Like on HBO or something, I don't know.

689
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:34,690
Scott: It was just on our TV a lot for some reason and it was getting, I just saw it a lot.

690
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,149
Rym: Saw a lot of Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones.

691
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:40,017
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't, like, looking for it, right?

692
00:43:40,138 --> 00:43:43,630
Scott: It just happened to be on our TV a lot, so I saw it many times.

693
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:47,950
Scott: And that was also around, like, you know, the peak Jim Carrey times, right?

694
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:52,650
Scott: When there was, like, nothing negative to say about him and I thought he was really hilarious.

695
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,425
Scott: You know, like, I thought The Mask was, like, a terrific movie, right?

696
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:56,190
Scott: You know, whatever.

697
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:05,650
Rym: Yeah, I guess for me it's funny because by 1995, I was such a weeb that I did not like these Batman movies and I was watching mostly anime.

698
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:12,448
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, but, you know, I guess nowadays it's sort of like, "Oh, that one?

699
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:12,770
Scott: Ehh.".

700
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:24,330
Scott: But I've just seen it so much, it's, like, imprinted on my brain, so it gets, like, plus nostalgia points just in me, even though I recognize that those are only points that I'm only giving it that it doesn't deserve.

701
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,638
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I do that to things.

702
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,340
Scott: Batman and Robin, though, is the one that- It does have some good entertaining elements, though.

703
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,305
Scott: It's, like, it's not all bad.

704
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,350
Scott: It's not, like, a garbage one.

705
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,009
Rym: It's not all bad like Batman and Robin.

706
00:44:33,812 --> 00:44:35,446
Scott: Right, that's the Schwarzenegger, Mr.

707
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:35,910
Scott: Freeze one.

708
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,069
Scott: Yeah, that one just- The only thing that's good is laughing at how silly the parts are.

709
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:45,390
Scott: And I think part of that drop was that Batman Forever- We saw that in the- I think we saw that in the theater when we were in college.

710
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,230
Rym: Batman Forever was a Joel Schumacher, but Tim Burton was still involved.

711
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:55,090
Rym: I'm pretty sure by the time they got to Batman and Robin, there was zero Tim Burton influence.

712
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:59,110
Rym: And then Tim Burton also became a much more mixed bag down the road.

713
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:03,621
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's how art is, right?

714
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:06,990
Scott: The people who can hit all home runs are so few.

715
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:14,130
Rym: But then there was a long gap, and I remember- because Batman Begins was like the next big reboot of Batman.

716
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:18,670
Rym: I think that's the kind of Batman a lot of people think of, like Christopher Nolan Batman.

717
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:25,264
Scott: Well, because what happened is we had this, you know, the doubt, right?

718
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:27,549
Scott: The crash towards the late 90s, right?

719
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:31,705
Scott: The comics books weren't selling anymore, right?

720
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:32,910
Scott: That whole thing was over with.

721
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,101
Scott: And then also, you know, the movies, right?

722
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:39,609
Scott: It's like they were less good, right?

723
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,300
Scott: And the whole thing fell apart, right?

724
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,970
Scott: And everyone sort of fell out of love with superheroes.

725
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:54,937
Scott: And it wasn't until later that someone, you know, it's like, listen, the only reason, you know, people do like that stuff, you just haven't been making good ones.

726
00:45:55,158 --> 00:46:04,470
Scott: And, you know, you stopped because Hollywood's conservative and, you know, wants to like bet on things that, you know, it thinks are going to get instead of, you know, taking a risk, right?

727
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:11,130
Scott: If they had just kept producing, but gotten the quality up, it's like people would have, you know, suddenly come back for it, right?

728
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,463
Scott: But I guess it's also, there's a fatigue or if you do too many, right?

729
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,910
Scott: And then, and you make them not good, right?

730
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,938
Scott: If there's too many not good ones, right?

731
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:22,730
Scott: So it's like with, you know, all these Marvel movies, they're cranking out.

732
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:29,690
Scott: It's like, I haven't watched any of them, but almost any of them, but there's also like the ones they keep cranking out.

733
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:34,445
Scott: It's like are good enough or at least enough of them are good enough, right?

734
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:35,990
Scott: That they can keep the thing going.

735
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:43,210
Scott: It's tough though, because if they put out, if they put out five stinkers in a row, you can see, watch how fast they just can't and there won't be anymore.

736
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,370
Scott: And they'll try, they'll close the whole shop and try again in like 10, 15 years.

737
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:55,350
Rym: I guess my problem was a lot of the Batman movies ended up feeling really Batman-y in like a predictable, boring way.

738
00:46:55,571 --> 00:47:00,890
Rym: To the point that I'd get bored watching them because they just, they felt like nothing interesting or new was going to happen.

739
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:12,610
Rym: Just Batman expected things would happen, but there wasn't as much, I don't want to say there wasn't as much artistry, but there wasn't the artistry and style that I was seeking from superhero movies anymore.

740
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,956
Scott: Like, as they transition from- You know, sometimes that works.

741
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:17,321
Scott: You get a James Bond movie, right?

742
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,750
Scott: It's like, yeah, they just do the same thing every time, but it's all good.

743
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:22,448
Rym: But then you flip it up and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

744
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:30,170
Rym: But like, Batman Begins was, instead of the Danny Elfman music, they had Hans Zimmer, which really set a different tone.

745
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:45,997
Rym: Coupled with the kinds of ways that Batman solved problems in that movie, felt a lot more like, punch someone until they tell you the secret as opposed to be clever and have like fancy su- Like, it rubbed me the wrong way, Batman Begins.

746
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:52,030
Rym: Plus the fact that it was two completely unrelated movies bolted together and way too long.

747
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:54,139
Scott: Yeah.

748
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,690
Rym: I think- Hundred and forty minutes, that movie.

749
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:57,879
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,770
Rym: Let's move on from movies, because we talked about these a lot, I think.

751
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,330
Scott: I was going to say, but yeah, those newer ones that everyone loves the shit out of, right?

752
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:15,218
Scott: It's like, I'm not, you know, the whatever, the Heath Ledger one where everyone is like, you know, where he died or whatever, and everyone thinks it's the greatest movie ever made.

753
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:18,430
Scott: It's like, nah, I don't understand why you like this.

754
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,081
Rym: That's why I noticed something, because I did see it.

755
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:21,329
Rym: I realized something about it.

756
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:29,450
Rym: That was the one, and there's a pattern of this, where the villains have good scenes and Batman is super boring and unnecessary to the movie.

757
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:34,570
Rym: Like, the villains just ended up being more interesting on screen and would steal the show.

758
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:42,690
Rym: Which, I think back in Venture Brothers, there's this random scene where this assassin is like, "I'm a fan of Batman," and he bonds with a kid, but he's going to kill the kid's dad.

759
00:48:43,051 --> 00:48:45,361
Rym: And the kid's like, "Wait, I thought you were a good guy.

760
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,405
Rym: You love Batman.

761
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:47,249
Rym: Batman wouldn't do

762
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:47,410
Rym: this.".

763
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,727
Rym: And the guy's like, "Ah, but you realize I only like Batman for his

764
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:52,269
Rym: villains.".

765
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:56,509
Rym: Batman villains were always pretty good.

766
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,029
Scott: I mean, that is, well, some of them are.

767
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,210
Rym: Well, the problem is the core set of Batman villains are good.

768
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:10,890
Scott: I do think that is one thing that sets Batman apart from almost every other superhero, right?

769
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:22,190
Scott: It's like, you know, people know Spider-Man, but like, you know, the Spider-Man villains, it's like, yeah, there are some okay ones, you know, but it's like, you know, Doctor Octopus or Green Goblin or whatever.

770
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,550
Rym: But like, okay, Hobgoblin, just like slightly crooked Green Goblin.

771
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,020
Scott: It's like, you know, the rhino.

772
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:28,746
Scott: It's like, what?

773
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:29,230
Scott: The lizard?

774
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:35,348
Rym: I could probably make up a couple Spider-Man villains and you'd be like, "Yeah, that sounds like a Spider-Man villain that we wouldn't care

775
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:35,489
Rym: about.".

776
00:49:36,092 --> 00:49:39,750
Scott: Before there were any Avengers movies, right, at all, right?

777
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,969
Scott: So, if you had, you know, people knew who Captain America was.

778
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:47,270
Scott: People knew, you know, Iron Man, at least there was some guy named Iron Man, right?

779
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,349
Scott: They knew that there was a Hulk for sure, especially because of the TV show.

780
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:58,690
Scott: But if you had asked anyone to name an Avengers villain, only a comic book nerd would have been able to tell you any, right, before any of these movies.

781
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,329
Scott: Now that there's movies, people can tell you.

782
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,630
Scott: But before the movies, could people have named an Avengers villain, right?

783
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,230
Scott: An enemy of Iron Man, right?

784
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:12,330
Rym: But Batman, like off the top of my head, like the Penguin Catwoman who's now complicated, Poison Ivy.

785
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:15,770
Scott: Could anyone have named a villain for Superman besides Lex Luthor?

786
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,190
Rym: Clayface, Two-Face.

787
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,757
Scott: Right, it's like, you know, Batman.

788
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:25,310
Scott: villains were actually like at the same level as, you know, heroes.

789
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,730
Scott: They could just have their own comic, you know, a lot of them.

790
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:29,016
Scott: Not all of them, right?

791
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:32,010
Scott: You know, some of them are a little, are still out there like Scarecrow or whatever.

792
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,424
Scott: You know, but it's like, you know.

793
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:43,390
Rym: But the thing about those villains is that in B-TAS, Batman the animated series did this best, but the Batmans I've liked, the villains are usually tragic as opposed to just evil.

794
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,070
Rym: There's always something tragic and sad.

795
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:54,450
Rym: Like a lot of Batman the animated series episodes ended with, "Well, that was a tragedy and that villain died, but probably didn't deserve to die.

796
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,442
Rym: They were bad, but they weren't that

797
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:56,825
Rym: bad.".

798
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:03,190
Scott: Well, I think it's, you know, if you look at any superhero story, period, right?

799
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,870
Scott: You have this hero who has their own story, right?

800
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:11,150
Scott: You know, Batman's story, his parents died, he's rich, he's got problems, you know.

801
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,427
Scott: So he goes out and does this Batman thing, right?

802
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:18,910
Scott: And you can only, it's like that's the story, the end.

803
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:26,609
Scott: It's like what more of this story, unless you're gonna like wrap up the story or advance that story and change the status quo, which you really can't do, right?

804
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,809
Scott: It's like there's nothing to tell there.

805
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:33,090
Scott: So if you make one Batman movie, you can tell that story, right?

806
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:39,429
Scott: If you make two Batman movies, you can't just tell the story again unless you start over, which they've done a few times.

807
00:51:39,731 --> 00:51:41,890
Rym: Which we talked about this in the past on GeekNights.

808
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:47,288
Rym: I'm real sick of, "Well, let's watch 30 minutes of Spider-Man's origin story again, the

809
00:51:47,328 --> 00:51:47,649
Rym: movie.".

810
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,230
Scott: Right, exactly.

811
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:56,770
Scott: So you have to, like if you make another thing, the story is not, you know, the hero's story.

812
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:58,309
Scott: The story is the villain's story.

813
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:02,169
Scott: It's like, you know, all right, Spider-Man's origin in issue one.

814
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,590
Scott: Issue two, Green Goblin's story, Spider-Man beats him.

815
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,722
Scott: Issue three, you know, it's like Mr.

816
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:11,550
Scott: Freeze's story, Batman beats him, right?

817
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:11,751
Scott: It's like.

818
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:16,890
Scott: you need, you know, to tell the villain's stories as you go forward, right?

819
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:30,610
Rym: And some of the best Batman stories almost ends up not so much direct, like he defeats the villain, but often indirectly, and usually he's just the one who bears witness to their downfall and their tragedy.

820
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,390
Scott: Well, because he doesn't have any actual superpowers, right?

821
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:39,170
Scott: Which also sets him apart from the other superheroes who all have at least some kind of power.

822
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:40,869
Scott: He's just a rich dude, right?

823
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:47,930
Scott: Iron Man is also a rich dude, but he puts on this iron suit that does things that are not physically possible.

824
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,170
Scott: So it's sort of, it's not, it's sci-fi supernatural, right?

825
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,730
Scott: Even though it's not hard sci-fi.

826
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,190
Rym: No, no, along those lines, there's something I gotta get out that I've been thinking about a lot.

827
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,970
Rym: It's come up in a bunch of conversations recently, but I've thought this even since I was a kid.

828
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:06,090
Rym: A not insignificant number of Batman villains are not wrong.

829
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:14,750
Rym: Like, in BTS, Poison Ivy, pretty much spot on and doing the right thing, and Batman was wrong to oppose her.

830
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,569
Scott: That depends on which one, you know.

831
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,490
Rym: Well, when Poison Ivy was basically going after all the rich people.

832
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:37,328
Scott: Oh, yeah, I mean, a lot of them are doing things with a good motive, but are doing things in a vigilante sort of way, which is the story they're trying to tell, is saying, "Hey, look, one person is seeking vigilante justice against evil

833
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:37,950
Scott: corporations."

834
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:38,353
Scott: And another

835
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:40,970
Rym: vigilante is seeking justice against the vigilante.

836
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:51,232
Scott: Right, and Batman is like, "I'm the only one who's the extra-legal," and he serves, you know, basically, right?

837
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:54,520
Scott: He wants, you know, if people are doing illegal things, right?

838
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:56,809
Scott: Or things that he views as harmful.

839
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:09,249
Rym: But a lot of times, the villain who turns into a supervillain is doing evil, but was also wronged, usually by a corporation, or someone who technically didn't do anything illegal, so Batman can't do anything to them.

840
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:15,330
Rym: Even though they are arguably the cause of the supervillain in the first place.

841
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,869
Scott: And Batman doesn't try to do anything to them.

842
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:28,929
Scott: I saw a really fascinating recent discourse talking about how, in the original incarnations of Batman-- The original one, he was just like a detective with a gun.

843
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,559
Rym: But back then, there was policing in America.

844
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,170
Rym: This is a whole topic we can't get into with any significant depth, nor are we experts.

845
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:55,990
Rym: But up until there was the North Hollywood shootout and a couple other incidents, there were some eras in American history where, irrespective of the problems of police and how we need to change that whole landscape, but criminals would literally outgun the police and local cops were barely armed.

846
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:08,310
Rym: And Batman, as a character, was basically someone who had way more weapons than the actual police to deal with supervillains who had way more weapons than the actual police.

847
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,329
Rym: And that was sort of a story that resonated with a lot of people.

848
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:17,350
Rym: But as time went on, modern police--like, look at actual fucking cops in America today.

849
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,114
Scott: They have better equipment.

850
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:23,710
Rym: They literally have equivalent equipment to what Batman Michael Keaton had in the movie.

851
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,590
Scott: Yeah, they're just Batman, right?

852
00:55:26,211 --> 00:55:30,816
Scott: Other than the unrealistic things, like the flying ship that won't actually fly-- But like the Batmobile?

853
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:34,110
Scott: A local cop car could take out the Batmobile today.

854
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:41,190
Scott: Yeah, Batarangs and grappling hooks are--I guess grappling hooks can be somewhat realistic, but not really.

855
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:45,689
Scott: Yeah, I mean, Boomerangs are real, but a Batarang would not work.

856
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:52,290
Rym: But in old Batman, the Batmobile is basically a tank and it can deal with the crazy supervillain shit.

857
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,707
Rym: But now, the cops have tanks.

858
00:55:55,732 --> 00:56:06,190
Scott: Yeah, and the Batmobile you see in most Batman things, sometimes it literally is a tank, but it's like an actual tank in the real world would beat most Batmobiles.

859
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:16,269
Rym: So, as a result, in the old days, Batman's power was, "I am powerful enough when the law enforcement isn't, and that's my

860
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:16,670
Rym: story.".

861
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:23,044
Rym: The story shifted over time in most Batman things into, "I don't have to follow the rules.

862
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:24,327
Rym: I am more

863
00:56:24,388 --> 00:56:24,809
Rym: powerful.".

864
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,435
Scott: Yep, the cops have their hands tied.

865
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:29,340
Scott: They can't just go and arrest this guy.

866
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:39,480
Rym: And this reality translates to beating people half to death to force them to talk and torture and extra-legal nonsense, and Batman kind of turned into 24.

867
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,380
Scott: Right, and there's also the Batman who's just such a good detective, the cops can't figure it out.

868
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,257
Scott: It's like something shady is going on.

869
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,085
Rym: I like that Batman a lot.

870
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:47,599
Rym: That kind of Batman I really enjoy.

871
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:51,500
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's something going on, right, and the cops are dum-dums and they can't figure it out.

872
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,675
Rym: Oh, I think it was in V-TAS.

873
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,940
Scott: Because it's something so advanced, right, and something so out there.

874
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:08,739
Scott: Because while Batman doesn't have anything supernatural or super going on, besides money and some slightly unrealistic weaponry, all the villains have unrealistic shit going on, right?

875
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,702
Scott: You know, Mr.

876
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:11,209
Scott: Freeze is out there freezing shit.

877
00:57:11,269 --> 00:57:13,640
Scott: It's like, that's superpowers, right?

878
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,680
Scott: Fucking Clayface, that's superpowers, and this normal dude's gonna go and fight that.

879
00:57:19,363 --> 00:57:31,720
Rym: God, I just remember, there's one scene, one of my favorite scenes, I think it was in V-TAS, was Batman broke into some criminal's house to read some documents, to figure out a crime, and some goon walks into the room, like doing a patrol, and sees Batman.

880
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:39,532
Rym: And Batman just looks at him, and he looks at Batman, and he just backs out of the room and shuts the door, and the other goon's like, "What's going on in

881
00:57:39,572 --> 00:57:39,693
Rym: there?".

882
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:40,116
Rym: and he's like,

883
00:57:40,196 --> 00:57:40,498
Rym: "Nothing.".

884
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,291
Rym: We've gone on a while about Batman.

885
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:47,540
Rym: I feel like it got a lot more to say.

886
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:50,979
Scott: Well, I mean, this is how many decades worth of Batman shit to talk about, right?

887
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,560
Rym: And also, despite the fact that I don't consume a lot of Batman media, like, I have consumed...

888
00:57:57,261 --> 00:58:05,359
Scott: It's such a huge cultural thing, it's like, everyone's got something to say about it, especially if you're a nerd of any kind, it's like, you've seen some Batman shit, you know what the deal is.

889
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:15,654
Rym: I will say, I do enjoy Batman in Harley Quinn, the current show that has Batman in it, because he's just a side character, like, Batman shows up, but when Batman would show up...

890
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:23,298
Scott: Like I was saying before, the story becomes the villain story, you can't just tell the hero's story every time.

891
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:47,340
Scott: I do think that, in general, the heroes that have been around a long time, if you've heard their story enough times already that you're no longer excited by it, that I think a lot of the best comic stories out there, superhero comic stories, regardless of medium, are the ones where the superhero... You're just in the world where the superhero is, right?

892
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,340
Scott: It's like, one of my favorite Batman comics is Gotham Central, it's actually about the cops.

893
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,780
Scott: It's about the cops, it's not about Batman, he exists, you see him sometimes, right?

894
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,619
Scott: But it's just fucking cops in Gotham being cops.

895
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,067
Scott: Do we never review that?

896
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:03,259
Rym: I thought we reviewed that, I read it.

897
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:17,419
Scott: I don't know, maybe, but it's just about the cops, and, you know, we have to work in a city where there is a Batman, so it's mostly like watching, you know, a Law and Order, even though I guess that's more about lawyers or a CSI, kind of, a little bit.

898
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,340
Scott: You know, but again, the things that they're tracking down are sometimes villains, right?

899
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,320
Scott: And a Batman exists, right?

900
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,040
Scott: So imagine you're watching Law and Order and a Batman exists, right?

901
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,540
Scott: In wherever city the CSI is, I don't know, right?

902
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:41,360
Scott: And it's, you know, much in the same way that fucking, right, Dark Knight Returns, the comic, right?

903
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,299
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's not about Superman, but Superman exists, right?

904
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:51,120
Rym: That said, I say this a lot, it's one of my canned lines, that is my favorite Superman comic.

905
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,840
Scott: It's a better Superman comic than a Batman comic, I think, right?

906
00:59:55,121 --> 01:00:12,440
Scott: It's like, yeah, there's a god who's flying around somewhere, it's like, that's way more interesting than whatever the fuck you're focusing on, and the old man Batman who gives a shit about that is a god who exists in this world, and you occasionally see glimpses of them, and when they appear, they act in a godlike fashion, right?

907
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,220
Scott: It's like, oh fuck.

908
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,040
Rym: So yeah, I think Batman will continue to loom large, possibly literally.

909
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:30,840
Scott: And, you know, I think the thing is, you know, I started by talking about how all the different takes on Batman, but what the thing is, I feel like they're running out of takes.

910
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:36,500
Scott: Now there's a whole set of them, right, and some of them are on, some of them are off.

911
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,860
Rym: They almost rotate through whatever is currently popular or whatever is needed to put Batman into another property.

912
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,340
Scott: Yeah, the campy one is currently turned off, but all the other ones are on, right?

913
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:54,940
Scott: I feel like it would be appropriate and also probably good to do a new one, right?

914
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,128
Scott: You know, we don't need to throw Batman out, right?

915
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:02,680
Scott: But let's do, you know, we went from campy Batman to gritty Batman.

916
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,760
Scott: You know, it's like, come up with a new, do Batman in a completely new way that hasn't been done before.

917
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:08,794
Scott: It's a challenge.

918
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,740
Rym: Has there been a cyberpunk anti-hero Batman?

919
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:13,620
Scott: I don't know, but it's like, you know.

920
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,978
Rym: Set in a near future dystopia?

921
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:17,929
Scott: I'm just saying, let's go for it, right?

922
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,219
Scott: It's like, you know, that's appropriate to do, right?

923
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,119
Rym: Batman who realizes the cops are corrupt and tries to fix things?

924
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,240
Scott: Yeah, do the anti-cop Batman, that's something appropriate for the times, right?

925
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,320
Scott: You talked about how the, you know, that original Batman was appropriate for the times, right?

926
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,920
Scott: Let's get a Batman who's appropriate for these times.

927
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,500
Rym: Have a Batman where the Gotham police are the villain.

928
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:45,879
Scott: Yeah, you know, Batman shows up and it's like, you know, the villain is like, hey.

929
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,060
Rym: Batman ends up like busting someone out of Arkham to help deal with those cops.

930
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:58,919
Scott: Or he goes back home and he's Bruce Wayne, he has billions and he uses the billions to fix the problems, right?

931
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,540
Rym: He starts funding the Batman franchises.

932
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:08,340
Rym: There you go, Batman funds Batman franchises to go do good works that are more focused and local.

933
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,597
Rym: That might have been done.

934
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:11,580
Scott: That may have been done already.

935
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,800
Rym: Every episode or like every series, season, you focus on another Batman franchise.

936
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,320
Scott: I don't know about that, but, you know, it's like, you want to show us something unrealistic?

937
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:24,960
Scott: Show me the billionaire who's not evil.

938
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,920
Rym: Give me young cyberpunk Batman with old Bruce Wayne mentor.

939
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:32,099
Scott: Yeah, Batman.

940
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:37,740
Scott: Oh, we somehow went this whole show without mentioning the best Batman character, which is Albert the Butler.

941
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:38,622
Rym: Oh, my God.

942
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:45,180
Rym: My favorite incarnation of Albert is still, well, the problem is Albert is so consistently good in everything.

943
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:46,800
Rym: Even a bad Batman movie.

944
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,200
Rym: Alfred is just fantastic.

945
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:50,259
Scott: Right, Alfred, not Alfred.

946
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,083
Rym: But the B-TAS.

947
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:59,860
Rym: Alfred was such a like, he would like, I realized very often he would be like, is this really the best use of your money, Bruce?

948
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,120
Rym: Perhaps there's a better way to solve that problem.

949
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,999
Rym: And Bruce is like, shut up, I'm going to go punch that guy.

950
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:13,880
Rym: Oh, what was the one where Alfred has to defend the lair and Batman's not home?

951
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,156
Rym: I forget what comic that was in.

952
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,080
Scott: Oh, and he's got, he just, you know, he starts shooting.

953
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:21,620
Rym: Actually, I feel like that happens in multiple Batman comics, that scene.

954
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:22,240
Scott: Probably.

955
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:24,920
Rym: In one of the movies, I don't think it ends well for Alfred.

956
01:03:28,562 --> 01:03:32,380
Rym: You know, I feel like we could do a show at some point on cool butlers in media.

957
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,519
Scott: Alright, name another cool butler.

958
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:40,840
Rym: Uh, the one in, uh, I'm trying to think of things that aren't just Batman.

959
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,319
Rym: They're all just iterations of Batman.

960
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:47,775
Rym: Or things that are based on Batman like Big O. God damn it.

961
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,320
Rym: Let's do a show on Alfred.

962
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,310
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

963
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:01,430
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

964
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:06,830
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

965
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:09,770
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

966
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:14,510
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

967
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:18,026
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

968
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,290
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

969
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:25,470
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

970
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:42,490
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... I gotta wait for this page to sort... (reading the names).

971
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,590
Rym: Michael Keaton is honestly my favorite live-action Batman.

972
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,069
Rym: It would be very hard for anything to unseat him.

973
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,799
Rym: So apropos of nothing, I leave you with...

974
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,790
Scott: And who do you think you are, a psychiatrist?

975
01:05:00,014 --> 01:05:00,749
Rym: Let's find out.

976
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:02,733
Rym: What?

977
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:04,609
Rym: Bloody hell.

978
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:07,450
Rym: It's billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne.

979
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:12,626
Rym: Oh, shitting me!

980
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:14,788
Rym: What is wrong with you?

981
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,429
Scott: Don't you think I would have done that had I wanted to?

982
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,490
Scott: Half the fun of our relationship was the mystery.

983
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:25,490
Scott: Now I know Batman is just some boring, rich asshole with parental issues.

984
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:26,790
Rym: That's really reductive.

985
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,430
Rym: Thanks for ruining the funnest thing I had going.

986
01:05:29,871 --> 01:05:32,229
Rym: Now I don't even feel like torturing him.
